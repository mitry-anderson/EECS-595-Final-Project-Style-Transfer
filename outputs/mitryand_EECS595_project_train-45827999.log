- This IS expected if you are initializing BertModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing BertModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).

You may observe training discrepancies if fine-tuning a model trained with versions anterior to 4.12.0. The decoder_input_ids are now created based on the labels, no need to pass them yourself anymore.

['[CLS] The Minutemen were instructed in the use of terrain for concealment. They were shown how to advance against an enemy outpost atop a cleared ridge. They practiced movement behind a smoke screen laid by smoke grenades ; ; and they attempted a skirmish line of advance against a camouflaged enemy encampment.

I will also be underpaid. The amazing thing is that this too is caused by the dearth of teachers. Teaching is at present a sellers'market ; ; as a result buyers, the public, must be satisfied with second - rate teachers.

The second mistake is Tibet. Tibet has historically served China as a buffer state. A friendly state, sometimes only semi - independent, but never hostile. China never tried to integrate Tibet by extirpating the people's religion and institutions. [SEP] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD]"]
