She thought again of her children , those two who had died young , before the later science which might have saved them could attach even a label to their separate malignancies .
The girl , her first , she barely remembered .
It could have been anyone's infant , for it had not survived the bassinet .
But the boy the boy had been alive yesterday .
Each successive movement in his growing was recorded on the unreeling film inside her .
He ran on his plump sticks of legs , freezing now and again into the sudden startled attitudes which the camera had caught and held on the paling photographs , all carefully placed and glued and labeled , resting in the fat plush album in the bottom drawer of the escritoire .
In the cruel clearness of her memory the boy remained unchanged , quick with the delight of laughter , and the pain with which she recalled that short destroyed childhood was still unendurable to her .
It was one with the desolate rocks and the alien water on those days when she hated the sea .
The brothers drove down together in Mark's small red sports car , Mark at the wheel .
They rarely spoke .
Abel sat and regarded the farm country which , spreading out from both sides of the road , rolled greenly up to where the silent white houses and long barns and silos nested into the tilled fields .
He saw the land with a stranger's eyes , all the old familiarness gone .
And it presented itself to him as it would to any stranger , impervious , complete in itself .
There was stability there , too -- a color which his life had had once .
That is what childhood is , he told himself .
Solid , settled lost .
In the stiff neutral lines of the telephone poles he saw the no-nonsense pen strokes of Aunt Jessica's letter .
What bad grace , what incredible selfishness he and Mark had shown .
The boyhood summers preceding their uncle's funeral might never have been .
They had closed over , absolutely , with the sealing of old Izaak's grave .
The small car flew on relentlessly .
The old woman , stubbornly reigning in the house above the crashing waters took on an ominous reality .
Abel moved and adjusted his long legs .
`` I suppose it has to do with the property '' , Mark had said over the telephone when they had discussed their receipt of the letters .
Not until the words had been spoken did Abel suddenly see the old house and the insistent sea , and feel his contrition blotted out in one shameful moment of covetousness .
He and Mark were the last of the family , and there lay the Cape Ann property which had seemed to have no end , stretching from horizon to horizon , in those golden days of summer .
Now Abel turned his head to look at his brother .
Mark held the wheel loosely , but his fingers curved around it in a purposeful way and the deliberate set of his body spoke plainly of the figure he'd make in the years to come .
His sandy hair was already beginning to thin and recede at the sides , and Abel looked quickly away .
Mark easily looked years older than himself , settled , his world comfortably categorized .
The vacation traffic was becoming heavier as they approached the sea .
`` She didn't mention bringing Myra '' , Mark said , maneuvering the car into the next lane .
`` She's probably getting old -- crotchety , I mean -- and we figured uh-uh , better not .
They've never met , you know .
But Myra wouldn't budge without an express invitation .
I feel kind of bad about it '' .
He gave Abel a quick glance and moved closer to the wheel , hugging it to him , and Abel caught this briefest of allusions to guilt .
`` I imagine the old girl hasn't missed us much '' , Mark added , his eyes on the road .
Abel ignored the half-expressed bid for confirmation .
He smiled .
It was barely possible that his brother was right .
He could tell they were approaching the sea .
The air took on a special strength now that they'd left the fecund warmth of the farmland behind .
There was the smell of the coast , like a primeval memory , composed of equal parts salt water , clams , seaweed and northern air .
He turned from the flying trees to look ahead and saw with an inward boy's eye again the great fieldstone house which , built on one of the many acres of ancestral land bordering the west harbor , had been Izaak's bride-gift to his cousin-wife as the last century ended .
Mark's thoughts must have been keeping silent pace beside his own , climbing the same crags in dirty white sneakers , clambering out on top of the headland and coming upon the sudden glinting water at the same instant .
`` Remember the Starbird ? ?
'' Mark asked , and Abel lifted his eyes from the double lines in the middle of the road , the twin white ribbons which the car swallowed rapidly as it ascended the crest of the hill and came down .
`` The Starbird , '' Abel said .
There was the day Uncle Izaak had , in an unexpected grandiose gesture , handed over the pretty sloop to Abel for keeps , on condition that he never fail to let his brother accompany him whenever younger the boy wished .
The two of them had developed into a remarkable sailing team all of this happening in a time of their lives when their youth and their brotherhood knitted them together as no other time or circumstance could .
They seemed then to have had a single mind and body , a mutuality which had been accepted with the fact of their youth , casually .
He saw the Starbird as she lay , her slender mast up and gently turning , its point describing constant languid circles against a cumulus sky .
Both of them had known the feeling of the small life in her waiting , ready , for the two of them to run up her sails .
The Starbird had been long at the bottom of the bay .
They came unexpectedly upon the sea .
Meeting it without preparation as they did , robbed of anticipation , a common disappointment seized them .
They were climbing the hill in the night when the headlights abruptly probed solid blackness , became two parallel luminous tubes which broadened out into a faint mist of light and ended .
Mark stopped the car and switched off the lights and they sat looking at the water , which , there being no moon out , at first could be distinguished from the sky only by an absence of stars .
His eyes were old and they never saw well , but heated with whisky they'd glare at my noise , growing red and raising up his rage .
I decided I hated the Pedersen kid too , dying in our kitchen while I was away where I couldn't watch , dying just to entertain Hans and making me go up snapping steps and down a drafty hall , Pa lumped under the covers at the end like dung covered with snow , snoring and whistling .
Oh he'd not care about the Pedersen kid .
He'd not care about getting waked so he could give up some of his whisky to a slit of a kid and maybe lose one of his hiding places in the bargain .
That would make him mad enough if he was sober .
I didn't hurry though it was cold and the Pedersen kid was in the kitchen .
He was all shoveled up like I thought he'd be .
I pushed at his shoulder , calling his name .
I think his name stopped the snoring but he didn't move except to roll a little when I shoved him .
The covers slid down his skinny neck so I saw his head , fuzzed like a dandelion gone to seed , but his face was turned to the wall -- there was the pale shadow of his nose on the plaster -- and I thought , Well you don't look much like a pig-drunk bully now .
I couldn't be sure he was still asleep .
He was a cagey sonofabitch .
I shook him a little harder and made some noise .
`` Pap-pap-pap-hey '' , I said .
I was leaning too far over .
I knew better .
He always slept close to the wall so you had to lean to reach him .
Oh he was smart .
It put you off .
I knew better but I was thinking of the Pedersen kid mother-naked in all that dough .
When his arm came up I ducked away but it caught me on the side of the neck , watering my eyes , and I backed off to cough .
Pa was on his side , looking at me , his eyes winking , the hand that had hit me a fist in the pillow .
`` Get the hell out of here '' .
I didn't say anything , trying to get my throat clear , but I watched him .
He was like a mean horse to come at from the rear .
It was better , though , he'd hit me .
He was bitter when he missed .
`` Get the hell out of here '' .
`` Big Hans sent me .
He told me to wake you '' .
`` A fat hell on Big Hans .
Get out of here '' .
`` He found the Pedersen kid by the crib '' .
`` Get the hell out '' .
Pa pulled at the covers .
He was tasting his mouth .
`` The kid's froze good .
Hans is rubbing him with snow .
He's got him in the kitchen '' .
`` Pedersen '' ? ?
`` No , Pa .
It's the Pedersen kid .
The kid '' .
`` Nothing to steal from the crib '' .
`` Not stealing , Pa .
He was just lying there .
Hans found him froze .
That's where he was when Hans found him '' .
Pa laughed .
`` I ain't hid nothing in the crib '' .
`` You don't understand , Pa .
The Pedersen kid .
The kid '' --
`` I goddamn well understand '' .
Pa had his head up , glaring , his teeth gnawing at the place where he'd grown a mustache once .
`` I goddamn well understand .
You know I don't want to see Pedersen .
That cock .
Why should I ? ?
What did he come for , hey ? ?
God dammit , get .
And don't come back .
Find out something .
You're a fool .
Both you and Hans .
Pedersen .
That cock .
Don't come back .
Out .
Out '' .
He was shouting and breathing hard and closing his fist on the pillow .
He had long black hairs on his wrist .
They curled around the cuff of his nightshirt .
`` Big Hans made me come .
Big Hans said '' --
`` A fat hell on Big Hans .
He's an even bigger fool than you are .
Fat , hey ? ?
I taught him , dammit , and I'll teach you .
Out .
You want me to drop my pot '' ? ?
He was about to get up so I got out , slamming the door .
He was beginning to see he was too mad to sleep .
Then he threw things .
Once he went after Hans and dumped his pot over the banister .
Pa'd been shit-sick in that pot .
Hans got an axe .
He didn't even bother to wipe himself off and he chopped part of Pa's door down before he stopped .
He might not have gone that far if Pa hadn't been locked in laughing fit to shake the house .
That pot put Pa in an awful good humor whenever he thought of it .
I always felt the memory was present in both of them , stirring in their chests like a laugh or a growl , as eager as an animal to be out .
I heard Pa cursing all the way downstairs .
Hans had laid steaming towels over the kid's chest and stomach .
He was rubbing snow on the kid's legs and feet .
Water from the snow and water from the towels had run off the kid to the table where the dough was , and the dough was turning pasty , sticking to the kid's back and behind .
`` Ain't he going to wake up '' ? ?
`` What about your pa '' ? ?
`` He was awake when I left '' .
`` What'd he say ? ?
Did you get the whisky '' ? ?
`` He said a fat hell on Big Hans '' .
`` Don't be smart .
Did you ask him about the whisky '' ? ?
`` Yeah '' .
`` Well '' ? ?
`` He said a fat hell on Big Hans '' .
`` Don't be smart .
What's he going to do '' ? ?
`` Go back to sleep most likely '' .
`` You'd best get that whisky '' .
`` You go .
Take the axe .
Pa's scared to hell of axes '' .
`` Listen to me , Jorge , I've had enough to your sassing .
This kid's froze bad .
If I don't get some whisky down him he might die .
You want the kid to die ? ?
Do you ? ?
Well , get your pa and get that whisky '' .
`` Pa don't care about the kid '' .
`` Jorge '' .
`` Well he don't .
He don't care at all , and I don't care to get my head busted neither .
He don't care , and I don't care to have his shit flung on me .
He don't care about anybody .
All he cares about is his whisky and that dry crack in his face .
Get pig-drunk -- that's what he wants .
He don't care about nothing else at all .
Nothing .
Not Pedersen's kid neither .
That cock .
Not the kid neither '' .
`` I'll get the spirits '' , Ma said .
I'd wound Big Hans up tight .
I was ready to jump but when Ma said she'd get the whisky it surprised him like it surprised me , and he ran down .
Ma never went near the old man when he was sleeping it off .
Not any more .
Not for years .
The first thing every morning when she washed her face she could see the scar on her chin where he'd cut her with a boot cleat , and maybe she saw him heaving it again , the dirty sock popping out as it flew .
It should have been nearly as easy for her to remember that as it was for Big Hans to remember going after the axe while he was still spattered with Pa's yellow sick insides .
`` No you won't '' , Big Hans said .
`` Yes , Hans , if they're needed '' , Ma said .
Hans shook his head but neither of us tried to stop her .
If we had , then one of us would have had to go instead .
Hans rubbed the kid with more snow rubbed rubbed .
`` I'll get more snow '' , I said .
I took the pail and shovel and went out on the porch .
I don't know where Ma went .
I thought she'd gone upstairs and expected to hear she had .
She had surprised Hans like she had surprised me when she said she'd go , and then she surprised him again when she came back so quick like she must have , because when I came in with the snow she was there with a bottle with three white feathers on its label and Hans was holding it angrily by the throat .
Oh , he was being queer and careful , pawing about in the drawer and holding the bottle like a snake at the length of his arm .
He was awful angry because he'd thought Ma was going to do something big , something heroic even , especially for her I know him I know him we felt the same sometimes while Ma wasn't thinking about that at all , not anything like that .
There was no way of getting even .
It wasn't like getting cheated at the fair .
They were always trying so you got to expect it .
Now Hans had given Ma something of his -- we both had when we thought she was going straight to Pa -- something valuable ; ;
but since she didn't know we'd given it to her , there was no easy way of getting it back .
Hans cut the foil off finally and unscrewed the cap .
He was put out too because there was only one way of understanding what she'd done .
Ma had found one of Pa's hiding places .
She'd found one and she hadn't said a word while Big Hans and I had hunted and hunted as we always did all winter , every winter since the spring that Hans had come and I had looked in the privy and found the first one .
Pa had a knack for hiding .
He knew we were looking and he enjoyed it .
But now Ma .
She'd found it by luck most likely but she hadn't said anything and we didn't know how long ago it'd been or how many other ones she'd found , saying nothing .
Pa was sure to find out .
Sometimes he didn't seem to because he hid them so well he couldn't find them himself or because he looked and didn't find anything and figured he hadn't hid one after all or had drunk it up .
But he'd find out about this one because we were using it .
A fool could see what was going on .
If he found out Ma found it -- that'd be bad .
He took pride in his hiding .
It was all the pride he had .
I guess fooling Hans and me took doing .
But he didn't figure Ma for much .
He didn't figure her at all , and if he found out a woman it'd be bad .
Hans poured some in a tumbler .
`` You going to put more towels on him '' ? ?
`` No '' .
`` Why not ? ?
That's what he needs , something warm to his skin , don't he '' ? ?
`` Not where he's froze good .
Heat's bad for frostbite .
That's why I only put towels on his chest and belly .
He's got to thaw slow .
You ought to know that '' .
Colors on the towels had run .
Ma poked her toe in the kid's clothes .
`` What are we going to do with these '' ? ?
Big Hans began pouring whisky in the kid's mouth but his mouth filled without any getting down his throat and in a second it was dripping from his chin .
`` Here , help me prop him up .
I got hold his mouth open '' .
I didn't want to touch him and I hoped Ma would do it but she kept looking at the kid's clothes piled on the floor and the pool of water by them and didn't make any move to .
`` Come on , Jorge '' .
`` All right '' .
`` Lift , don't shove lift '' .
`` O.K. , I'm lifting '' .
I took him by the shoulders .
His head flopped back .
His mouth fell open .
The skin on his neck was tight .
He was cold all right .
`` Hold his head up .
He'll choke '' .
`` His mouth is open '' .
`` His throat's shut .
He'll choke '' .
`` He'll choke anyway '' .
`` Hold his head up '' .
`` I can't '' .
`` Don't hold him like that .
Put your arms around him '' .
`` Well Jesus '' .
He was cold all right .
I put my arm carefully around him .
Hans had his fingers in the kid's mouth .
`` Now he'll choke for sure '' .
`` Shut up .
Just hold him like I told you '' .
He was cold all right , and wet .
I had my arm behind his back .
He was in his mid-fifties at this time , long past the establishment of his name and the wish to be lionized yet once again , and it was almost a decade since he had sworn off lecturing .
There was never a doubt any more how his structures would be received ; ;
it was always the same unqualified success now .
He could no longer build anything , whether a private residence in his Pennsylvania county or a church in Brazil , without it being obvious that he had done it , and while here and there he was taken to task for again developing the same airy technique , they were such fanciful and sometimes even playful buildings that the public felt assured by its sense of recognition after a time , a quality of authentic uniqueness about them , which , once established by an artist as his private vision , is no longer disputable as to its other values .
Stowey Rummel was internationally famous , a crafter of a genuine Americana in foreign eyes , an original designer whose inventive childishness with steel and concrete was made even more believably sincere by his personality .
He had lived for almost thirty years in this same stone farmhouse with the same wife , a remarkably childish thing in itself ; ;
he rose at half-past six every morning , made himself some French coffee , had his corn flakes and more coffee , smoked four cigarettes while reading last Sunday's Herald Tribune and yesterday's Pittsburgh Gazette , then put on his high-topped farmer's shoes and walked under a vine bower to his workshop .
This was an enormously long building whose walls were made of rocks , some of them brought home from every continent during his six years as an oil geologist .
The debris of his other careers was piled everywhere ; ;
a pile of wire cages for mice from his time as a geneticist and a microscope lying on its side on the window sill , vertical steel columns wired for support to the open ceiling beams with spidery steel cantilevers jutting out into the air , masonry constructions on the floor from the time he was inventing his disastrous fireplace whose smoke would pass through a whole house , visible all the way up through wire gratings on each floor .
His files , desk , drafting board and a high stool formed the only clean island in the chaos .
Everywhere else his ideas lay or hung in visible form : his models , drawings , ten-foot canvases in monochromes from his painting days , and underfoot a windfall of broken-backed books that looked as though their insides had been ransacked by a maniac .
Bicycle gear-sets he had once used as the basis of the design for the Camden Cycly Company plant hung on a rope in one corner , and over his desk , next to several old and dusty hats , was a clean pair of roller skates which he occasionally used up and down in front of his house .
He worked standing , with his left hand in his pocket as though he were merely stopping for a moment , sketching with the surprised stare of one who was watching another person's hand .
Sometimes he would grunt softly to some invisible onlooker beside him , sometimes he would look stern and moralistic as his pencil did what he disapproved .
It all seemed -- if one could have peeked in at him through one of his windows -- as though this broken-nosed man with the muscular arms and wrestler's neck was merely the caretaker trying his hand at the boss's work .
This air of disengagement carried over to his apparent attitude toward his things , and people often mistook it for boredom in him or a surrender to repetitious routine .
But he was not bored at all ; ;
he had found his style quite early in his career and he thought it quite wonderful that the world admired it , and he could not imagine why he should alter it .
There are , after all , fortunate souls who hear everything , but only know how to listen to what is good for them , and Stowey was , as things go , a fortunate man .
He left his home the day after New Year's wearing a mackinaw and sheepskin mittens and without a hat .
He would wear this same costume in Florida , despite his wife Cleota's reminders over the past five days that he must take some cool clothes with him .
But he was too busy to hear what she was saying .
So they parted when she was in an impatient humor .
When he was bent over behind the wheel of the station wagon , feeling in his trouser cuffs for the ignition key which he had dropped a moment before , she came out of the house with an enormous Rumanian shawl over her head , which she had bought in that country during one of their trips abroad , and handed him a clean handkerchief through the window .
Finding the key under his shoe , he started the engine , and while it warmed up he turned to her standing there in the dripping fog , and said , `` Defrost the refrigerator '' .
He saw the surprise in her face , and laughed as though it were the funniest expression he had ever seen .
He kept on laughing until she started laughing with him .
He had a deep voice which was full of good food she had cooked , and good humor ; ;
an explosive laugh which always carried everything before it .
He would settle himself into his seat to laugh .
Whenever he laughed it was all he was doing .
And she was made to fall in love with him again there in the rutted dirt driveway standing in the cold fog , mad as she was at his going away when he really didn't have to , mad at their both having got older in a life that seemed to have taken no more than a week to go by .
She was forty-nine at this time , a lanky woman of breeding with an austere , narrow face which had the distinction of a steeple or some architecture that had been designed long ago for a stubborn sort of prayer .
Her eyebrows were definite and heavy and formed two lines moving upward toward a high forehead and a great head of brown hair that fell to her shoulders .
There was an air of blindness in her gray eyes , the startled-horse look that ultimately comes to some women who are born at the end of an ancestral line long since divorced from money-making and which , besides , has kept its estate intact .
She was personally sloppy , and when she had colds would blow her nose in the same handkerchief all day and keep it , soaking wet , dangling from her waist , and when she gardened she would eat dinner with dirt on her calves .
But just when she seemed to have sunk into some depravity of peasanthood she would disappear and come down bathed , brushed , and taking breaths of air , and even with her broken nails her hands would come to rest on a table or a leaf with a thoughtless delicacy , a grace of history , so to speak , and for an instant one saw how ferociously proud she was and adamant on certain questions of personal value .
She even spoke differently when she was clean , and she was clean now for his departure and her voice clear and rather sharp .
`` Now drive carefully , for God's sake '' ! !
She called , trying to attain a half humorous resentment at his departure .
But he did not notice , and was already backing the car down to the road , saying `` Toot-toot '' ! !
To the stump of a tree as he passed it , the same stump which had impaled the car of many a guest in the past thirty years and which he refused to have removed .
She stood clutching her shawl around her shoulders until he had swung the car onto the road .
Then , when he had it pointed down the hill , he stopped to gaze at her through the window .
She had begun to turn back toward the house , but his look caught her and she stood still , waiting there for what his expression indicated would be a serious word of farewell .
He looked at her out of himself , she thought , as he did only for an instant at a time , the look which always surprised her even now when his uncombable hair was yellowing a little and his breath came hard through his nicotine-choked lungs , the look of the gaunt youth she had suddenly found herself staring at in the Tate Gallery on a Thursday once .
Now she kept herself protectively ready to laugh again and sure enough he pointed at her with his index finger and said `` Toot '' ! !
Once more and roared off into the fog , his foot evidently surprising him with the suddenness with which it pressed the accelerator , just as his hand did when he worked .
She walked back to the house and entered , feeling herself returning , sensing some kind of opportunity in the empty building .
There is a death in all partings , she knew , and promptly put it out of her mind .
She enjoyed great parties when she would sit up talking and dancing and drinking all night , but it always seemed to her that being alone , especially alone in her house , was the realest part of life .
Now she could let out the three parakeets without fear they would be stepped on or that Stowey would let them out one of the doors ; ;
she could dust the plants , then break off suddenly and pick up an old novel and read from the middle on ; ;
improvise cha-chas on the harp ; ;
and finally , the best part of all , simply sit at the plank table in the kitchen with a bottle of wine and the newspapers , reading the ads as well as the news , registering nothing on her mind but letting her soul suspend itself above all wishing and desire .
She did this now , comfortably aware of the mist running down the windows , of the silence outside , of the dark afternoon it was getting to be .
She fell asleep leaning on her hand , hearing the house creaking as though it were a living a private life of its own these two hundred years , hearing the birds rustling in their cages and the occasional whirring of wings as one of them landed on the table and walked across the newspaper to perch in the crook of her arm .
Every few minutes she would awaken for a moment to review things : Stowey , yes , was on his way south , and the two boys were away in school , and nothing was burning on the stove , and Lucretia was coming for dinner and bringing three guests of hers .
Then she fell asleep again as soddenly as a person with fever , and when she awoke it was dark outside and the clarity was back in her eyes .
She stood up , smoothing her hair down , straightening her clothes , feeling a thankfulness for the enveloping darkness outside , and , above everything else , for the absence of the need to answer , to respond , to be aware even of Stowey coming in or going out , and yet , now that she was beginning to cook , she glimpsed a future without him , a future alone like this , and the pain made her head writhe , and in a moment she found it hard to wait for Lucretia to come with her guests .
She went into the living room and turned on three lamps , then back into the kitchen where she turned on the ceiling light and the switch that lit the floods on the barn , illuminating the driveway .
She knew she was feeling afraid and inwardly laughed at herself .
They were both so young , after all , so unready for any final parting .
How could it have been thirty years already , she wondered ? ?
But yes , nineteen plus thirty was forty-nine , and she was forty-nine and she had been married at nineteen .
She stood still over the leg of lamb , rubbing herbs into it , quite suddenly conscious of a nausea in her stomach and a feeling of wrath , a sensation of violence that started her shivering .
But they all said , `` No , your time will come .
Enjoy being a bride while you can '' .
There was no room for company in the tiny Weaning House ( where the Albright boys always took their brides , till they could get a house and a farm of their own ) .
So when the Big House filled up and ran over , the sisters-in-law found beds for everyone in their own homes .
And there was still not anything that Linda Kay could do .
So Linda Kay gave up asking , and accepted her reprieve .
Without saying so , she was really grateful ; ;
for to attend the dying was something she had never experienced , and certainly had not imagined when she thought of the duties she would have as Bobby Joe's wife .
She had made curtains for all the windows of her little house , and she had kept it spotless and neat , shabby as it was , and cooked good meals for Bobby Joe .
She had done all the things she had promised herself she would do , but she had not thought of this .
People died , she would have said , in hospitals , or in cars on the highway at night .
Bobby Joe was gone all day now , not coming in for dinner and sometimes not for supper .
When they first married he had been working in the fields all day , and she would get in the car and drive to wherever he was working , to take him a fresh hot meal .
Now there was no work in the fields , nor would there be till it rained , and she did not know where he went .
Not that she complained , or had any cause to .
Four or five of the cousins from East Texas were about his age , so naturally they ran around together .
There was no reason for her to ask what they did .
Thus a new pattern of days began to develop , for Granny Albright did not die .
She lay still on the bed , her head hardly denting the pillow ; ;
sometimes she opened her eyes and looked around , and sometimes she took a little milk or soup .
They stopped expecting her to die the next minute , but only in the next day or two .
Those who had driven hundreds of miles for the burial would not go home , for she might die any time ; ;
but they might as well unpack their suitcases , for she might linger on .
So the pattern was established .
When Linda Kay had put up her breakfast dishes and mopped her linoleum rugs , she would go to the Big House .
There was not anything she could do there , but that was where everyone was , or would be .
Bobby Joe and the boys would come by , say `` How's Granny '' ? ?
And sit on the porch a while .
The older men would be there at noon , and maybe rest for a time before they took their guns off to the creek or drove down the road towards town .
The women and children stayed at the Albrights' .
The women , keeping their voices low as they worked around the house or sat in the living room , sounded like chickens shut up in a coop for the night .
The children had to play away from the house ( in the barn loft or the pasture behind the barn ) , to maintain a proper quietness .
Off and on , all day , someone would be wiping at the powdery gray dust that settled over everything .
The evaporative cooler had been moved to Granny's room , and her door was kept shut ; ;
so that the rest of the house stayed open , though there was a question as to whether it was hotter or cooler that way .
The dust clogged their throats , and the heat parched them , so that the women were always making ice water .
They had cleaned up an old ice box and begun to buy fifty-pound blocks of ice in town , as the electric refrigerator came nowhere near providing enough ice for the crowds who ate and drank there .
One afternoon , as the women sat clucking softly , a new carload of people pulled up at the gate .
It was a Cadillac , black grayed with the dust of the road , its windows closed tight so you knew that the people who climbed out of it would be cool and unwrinkled .
They were an old fat couple ( as Linda Kay described them to herself ) , a thick middle-aged man , and a girl about ten or twelve .
There was much embracing , much exclaiming .
`` Cousin Ada ! !
Cousin John '' ! !
`` Cousin Lura '' ! !
`` Cousin Howard '' ! !
`` And how is she '' ? ?
`` About the same , John , about the same '' .
All the women got up and offered their chairs , and when they were all seated again , the guests made their inquiries and their explanations .
`` We were on our vacation in Canada '' , Howard explained , in a muffled voice that must have been used to booming , `` and the news didn't catch up with us till we were nearly home .
We came on as soon as we could '' .
There was the suggestion of ice water , and -- in spite of the protest `` We're not really thirsty '' -- Linda Kay , to escape the stuffy air and the smothering soft voices , hurried to the kitchen .
She filled a big pitcher and set it , with glasses , on a tray .
Carrying it to the living room , she imagined the picture she made : tall and roundly slim , a bit sophisticated in her yellow sheath , with a graceful swingy walk that she had learned as a twirler with the school band .
Almost immediately she was ashamed of herself for feeling vain , at such a time , in such a place , and she tossed back her long yellow hair , smiling shyly as she entered the room .
Howard ( the thick middle-aged man ) was looking at her .
She felt the look and looked back because she could not help it , seeing that he was neither as old nor as thick as she had at first believed .
`` And who is this '' ? ?
He asked , when she passed him a glass .
`` Oh that's Linda Kay '' , Mama Albright said fondly .
`` She married our baby boy , Bobby Joe , this summer '' .
`` Let's see '' , Cousin Ada said .
`` He's a right smart younger than the rest '' ? ?
`` Oh yes '' , Mama laughed .
`` He's ten years younger than Ernest .
We didn't expect him to come along ; ;
thought for the longest he was a tumor '' .
This joke was not funny to Linda Kay , and she blushed , as she always did ; ;
then , hearing the muffled boom of Howard's laughter , blushed redder .
`` Who is Howard , anyway '' ? ?
She asked Bobby Joe that night .
`` He makes me uncomfortable '' .
`` Oh he's a second cousin or something .
He got in the oil business out at Odessa and lucked into some money '' .
`` How old is he '' ? ?
`` Gosh , I don't know .
Thirty-five , I guess .
He's been married and got this half-grown kid .
If he bothers you , don't pay him any mind .
He's just a big windbag '' .
Bobby Joe was thinking about something else .
`` Say , did you know they're fixing to have a two-day antelope season on the Double J '' ? ?
He was talking about antelope again when they woke up .
`` Listen , I never had a chance to kill an antelope .
There never was a season before , but now they want to thin 'em out on account of the drouth '' .
`` Did he ever visit here when he was a kid '' ? ?
Linda Kay asked .
`` Who '' ? ?
`` Howard '' .
`` Hell , I don't know .
When he was a kid I wasn't around '' .
Bobby Joe took a gun from behind the door , and with a quick `` Bye now '' was gone for the day .
Almost immediately Howard and his daughter Debora drove up in the Cadillac .
`` We're going after ice '' , Howard said , `` and thought maybe you'd go along and keep us company '' .
There was really no reason to refuse , and Linda Kay had never ridden in a Cadillac .
Driving along the caliche-topped road to town , Howard talked .
Finally he said , `` Tell me about yourself '' , and Linda Kay told him , because she thought herself that she had had an interesting life .
She was such a well-rounded teenager , having been a twirler , Future Farmers sweetheart , and secretary of Future Homemakers .
In her sophomore year she had started going steady with Bobby Joe , who was a football player , Future Homemakers sweetheart , and president of Future Farmers .
It was easy to see that they were made for each other , and they knew what they wanted .
Bobby Joe would be a senior this year , and he planned to graduate .
But there was no need for Linda Kay to go on , since all she wanted in life was to make a home for Bobby Joe and ( blushing ) raise his children .
Howard sighed .
`` You lucky kids '' , he said .
`` I'd give anything if I could have found a girl like you '' .
Then he told Linda Kay about himself .
Of course he couldn't say much , really , because of Debora , but Linda Kay could imagine what kind of woman his wife had been and what a raw deal he had got .
It made her feel different about Howard .
She was going to tell Bobby Joe about how mistaken she had been , but he brought one of the cousins home for supper , and all they did was talk about antelope .
Bobby Joe was trying to get Linda Kay to say she would cook one if he brought it home .
`` Cook a whole antelope '' ? ?
She exclaimed .
`` Why , I couldn't even cook a piece of antelope steak ; ;
I never even saw any '' .
`` Oh , you could .
I want to roast the whole thing , and have it for the boys '' .
Linda Kay told him he couldn't do anything like that with his Grandma dying , and he said well they had to eat , didn't they , they weren't all dying .
Linda Kay felt like going off to the bedroom to cry ; ;
but they were going up to the Big House after supper , and she had to put on a clean dress and fix her hair a little .
Every night they all went to Mama and Papa Albright's , and sat on the open front porch , where they could get the breeze .
It was full-of-the-moon ( or a little past ) , and nearly light as day .
They all sat around and drank ice water , and the men smoked , and everybody had a good time .
Once in a while they said what a shame it was , with Granny dying , but they all agreed she wouldn't have wanted it any other way .
That night the older men got to talking about going possum-hunting on a moonlight night .
Bobby Joe and two or three of the other boys declared they had never been possum-hunting , and Uncle Bill Farnworth ( from Mama Albright's side of the family ) said he would just get up from there and take them , right then .
After they had left , some of the people moved around , to find more comfortable places to sit .
There were not many chairs , so that some preferred to sit on the edge of the porch , resting their feet on the ground , and others liked to sit where they could lean back against the wall .
Howard , who had been sitting against the wall , said he needed more fresh air , and took the spot on the edge of the porch where Bobby Joe had been sitting .
`` You'll be a darn sight more comfortable there , Howard '' , Ernest said , laughing , and they all laughed .
Linda Kay felt that she was not exactly more comfortable .
Bobby Joe had been sitting close to her , touching her actually , and holding her hand from time to time , but it seemed at once that Howard sat much closer .
Perhaps it was just that he had so much more flesh , so that more of it seemed to come in contact with hers ; ;
but she had never been so aware of anyone's flesh before .
Still she was not sorry he sat by her , but in fact was flattered .
He had become the center of the company , such stories he had to tell .
He had sold oil stock to Bob Hope and Bing Crosby in person ; ;
he had helped fight an oil-well fire that raged six days and nights .
`` But tell me , doctor , where do you plan to conduct the hatching '' ? ?
Alex asked .
`` That will have to be in the hotel '' , the doctor retorted , confirming Alex's anticipations .
`` What I want you to do is to go to the market with me early tomorrow morning and help smuggle the hen back into the hotel '' .
The doctor paid the bill and they repaired to the hotel , room number nine , to initiate Alex further into these undertakings .
The doctor opened the smallest of his cases , an unimposing straw bag , and exposed the contents for Alex's inspection .
Inside , carefully packed in straw , were six eggs , but the eye of a poultry psychologist was required to detect what scientifically valuable specimentalia lay inside ; ;
to Alex they were merely six not unusual hens' eggs .
There was little enough time to contemplate them , however ; ;
in an instant the doctor was stalking across the room with an antique ledger in his hands , thoroughly eared and big as a table top .
He placed it on Alex's lap .
`` This is my hen ledger '' , he informed him in an absorbed way .
`` It's been going since 1908 when I was a junior in college .
That first entry there is the Vermont Flumenophobe , the earliest and one of the most successful of my eighty-three varieties -- great big scapulars and hardly any primaries at all .
Couldn't take them near a river , though , or they'd squawk like a turkey cock the day before Thanksgiving '' .
The ledger was full of most precise information : date of laying , length of incubation period , number of chick reaching the first week , second week , fifth week , weight of hen , size of rooster's wattles and so on , all scrawled out in a hand that looked more Chinese than English , the most jagged and sprawling Alex had ever seen .
Below these particulars was a series of alpha-beta-gammas connected by arrows and crosses which denoted the lineage of the breed .
Alex's instruction was rapid , for the doctor had to go off to the Rue Ecole De Medecine to hear more speeches with only time for one sip of wine to sustain him through them all .
But after the doctor's return that night Alex could see , from the high window in his own room , the now familiar figure crouched on a truly impressive heap of towels , apparently giving its egg-hatching powers one final chance before it was replaced in its office by a sure-enough hen .
A knocking at Alex's door roused him at six o'clock the following morning .
It was the doctor , dressed and ready for the expedition to the market , and Alex was obliged to prepare himself in haste .
The doctor stood about , waiting for Alex to dress , with a show of impatience , and soon they were moving , as quietly as could be , through the still-dark hallways , past the bedroom of the patronne , and so into the street .
The market was not far and , once there , the doctor's sense of immediacy left him and he fell into a state of harmony with the birds around him .
He stroked the hens and they responded with delighted clucks , he gobbled with the turkeys and they at once were all attention , he quacked with the ducks , and cackled with a pair of exceedingly flattered geese .
The dawn progressed and it seemed that the doctor would never be done with his ministrations when quite abruptly something broke his revery .
It was a fine broody hen , white , with a maternal eye and a striking abundance of feathers in the under region of the abdomen .
The doctor , with the air of a man whose professional interests have found scope , drew Alex's attention to those excellences which might otherwise have escaped him : the fine color in comb and wattles , the length and quality of neck and saddle hackles , the firm , wide spread of the toes , and a rare justness in the formation of the ear lappets .
All search was ended ; ;
he had found his fowl .
The purchase was effected and they made their way towards the hotel again , the hen , with whom some sort of communication had been set up , nestling in the doctor's arms .
The clocks struck seven-thirty as they approached the hotel entrance ; ;
and hopes that the chambermaid and patronne would still be abed began to rise in Alex's well exercised breast .
The doctor was wearing a long New England greatcoat , hardly necessary in the June weather but a garment which proved well adapted to the sequestration of hens .
Alex entered first and was followed by the doctor who , for all his care , manifested a perceptible bulge on his left side where the hen was cradled .
They advanced in a line across the entrance hall to the stairway and up , with gingerly steps , towards the first landing .
It was then that they heard the tread of one descending and , in some perturbation glancing up , saw the patronne coming towards them as they gained the landing .
`` Bonjour , messieurs , vous etes matinals '' , she greeted them pleasantly .
Alex explained that they had been out for a stroll before breakfast while the doctor edged around behind him , attempting to hide the protuberance at his left side behind Alex's arm and back .
`` Vous voulez vos petits dejeuners tout de suite alors '' ? ?
Their hostess enquired .
Alex told her that there was no hurry for their breakfasts , trying at the same time to effect a speedy separation of the persons before and behind him .
The doctor , he noticed , was attempting a transverse movement towards the stairs , but before the movement could be completed a distinct and audible cluck ruffled the air in the hollow of the stair-well .
Eyes swerved in the patronne's head , Alex coughed loudly , and the doctor , with a sforzando of chicken noises floating behind him , took to the stairs in long-shanked leaps .
`` Comment '' ? ?
Ejaculated the surprised woman , looking at Alex for an explanation but he , parting from her without ceremony , only offered a few words about the doctor's provincial American speech and a state of nerves brought on by the demands of his work .
With that he hurried up the stairs , followed by her suspicious gaze .
When Alex entered his room , the doctor was already preparing a nest in the straw case , six eggs ready for the hen's attentions .
There was no reference to the incident on the stairs , his powers being absorbed by this more immediate business .
The hen appeared to have no doubts as to her duties and was quick to settle down to the performance of them .
One part of her audience was totally engaged , the connoisseur witnessing a peculiarly fine performance of some ancient classic , the other part , the guest of the connoisseur , attentive as one who must take an intelligent interest in that which he does not fully understand .
The spectacle progressed towards a denouement which was obviously still remote ; ;
the audience attended .
Time elapsed but the doctor was obviously unconscious of its passage until an unwelcome knock on the door interrupted the processes of nature .
Startled , he jumped up to pull hen and case out of view , and Alex went to the door .
He opened it a crack and in doing so made as much shuffling , coughing , and scraping noise as possible in order to drown emanations from the hen who had begun to protest .
It was Giselle , the fille de chambre , come to clean the room , and while she stood before him with ears pricked up and regard all curiosity , explaining her errand , Alex could see from the corner of his eye the doctor doing all he could to calm the displeased bird .
Giselle was reluctant but Alex succeeded in persuading her to come back in five minutes and the door was shut again .
`` Who was that , young feller '' ? ?
The doctor instantly asked .
`` That was the fille de chambre , the one you thought couldn't get the eggs out .
She looked mighty interested , though .
Anyhow she's coming back in five minutes to do the room '' .
The doctor's mind was working at a great speed ; ;
he rose to put his greatcoat on and addressed Alex in a muted voice .
`` Have you got our keys handy '' ? ?
`` Right in my pocket '' .
`` All right .
Now you go outside and beckon me when it's safe '' .
The hall was empty and Alex beckoned ; ;
they climbed the stairs which creaked , very loudly to their sensitive ears , and reached the next floor .
A guest was locking his room ; ;
they passed behind him and got to Alex's room unnoticed .
The doctor sat down rather wearily , caressing the hen and remarking that the city was not the place for a poultry-loving man , but no sooner was the remark out than a knock at this door obliged him to cover the hen with his greatcoat once more .
At the door Alex managed to persuade the increasingly astonished fille de chambre to return in ten minutes .
It was evident that a second transfer had to be effected , and that it had to take place between the time the fille finished the doctor's room and the time she began Alex's .
They waited three minutes and then crept out on tip-toe ; ;
the halls were empty and they passed down the stairs to number nine and listened at the door .
A bustle of sheets being smoothed and pillows being arranged indicated the fille de chambre's presence inside ; ;
they listened and suddenly a step towards the door announced another important fact .
The doctor shot down to the lavatory and turned the doorknob , but to no effect : the lavatory was occupied .
Although a look of alarm passed over his face , he did not arrest his movements but disappeared into the shower room just as the chambermaid emerged from number nine .
Alex suppressed those expressions of relief which offered to prevail in his face and escape from his throat ; ;
unwarranted they were in any case for , as he stood facing the fille de chambre , his ears were assailed by new sounds from the interior of the shower room .
The events of the last quarter of an hour , mysterious to any bird accustomed only to the predictable life of coop and barnyard , had overcome the doctor's hen and she gave out a series of cackly wails , perhaps mourning her nest , but briefly enjoyed .
The doctor's wits had not left him , however , for all his sixty-eight years , and the wails were almost immediately lost in the sound of water rushing out from the showerhead .
Alex nodded to the maid as though nothing unusual were taking place and entered the doctor's room .
Shortly , the doctor himself entered , his hair somewhat wet from the shower , but evidently satisfied with the outcome of their adventures .
Without comment he opened the closet and from its shelves constructed a highboard around the egg case which he had placed on the floor inside .
Next , the hen was nested and all seemed well .
The two men sat for some time , savoring the pleasure of escape from peril and the relief such escape brings , before they got up and left the hotel , the doctor to go to the conference house and Alex to go to the main post office .
Alex returned to the hotel , rather weary and with no new prospects of a role , in the late afternoon , but found the doctor in an ebullient mood .
At the time Alex arrived he was engaged in some sort of intimate communication with the hen , who had settled herself on the nest most peacefully after the occurrences of the morning .
`` Chickens have short memories '' , the doctor remarked , `` that's why they are better company than most people I know '' , and he went on to break some important news to Alex .
`` Well '' , he began , `` It seems like some people in Paris want to hear more from me than those fellers over at the conference house do .
They've got a big vulture from Tanganika at the zoo here , with a wife for him , too , very rare birds , both of them , the only Vulturidae of their species outside Africa .
Seems like she's willing , but the male just flops around all day like the bashful boy who took Jeannie May behind the barn and then didn't know what to do , and the people at the zoo haven't got any vulture chicks to show for their trouble .
Going downstairs with the tray , Winston wished he could have given in to Miss Ada , but he knew better than to do what she said when she had that little-girl look .
There were times it wasn't right to make a person happy , like the times she came in the kitchen and asked know we don't keep peanut `` butter for a peanut butter sandwich .
You in this house '' , he always told her .
`` Why , Winston '' , she'd cry , `` I just now saw you eating it out of the jar '' ! !
But he knew how important it was for her to keep her figure .
In the kitchen , Leona , his little young wife , was reading the morning paper .
Her legs hung down long and thin as she sat on the high stool .
`` Here '' , Winston said gently , `` what's these dishes doing not washed '' ? ?
The enormous plates which had held Mr. Jack's four fried eggs and five strips of bacon were still stacked in the sink .
`` Leave me alone '' , Leona said .
`` Can't you see I'm busy '' ? ?
She looked at him impudently over the corner of the paper .
`` This is moving day '' , Winston reminded her , `` and I bet you left things every which way upstairs , your clothes all over the floor and the bed not made .
Leona '' ! !
His eye had fastened on her leg ; ;
bending , he touched her knee .
`` If I catch you one more time down here without stockings '' --
She twitched her leg away .
`` Fuss , fuss , old man '' .
She had an alley cat's manners .
Winston stacked Miss Ada's thin pink dishes in the sink .
Then he spread out the last list on the counter .
`` To Be Left Behind '' was printed at the top in Miss Ada ; ;
fine hand .
Winston took out a pencil , admired the point , and wrote slowly and heavily , `` Clothes Stand '' .
Sighing , Leona dropped the paper and stood up .
`` I guess I better get ready to go '' .
Winston watched her fumbling to untie her apron .
`` Here '' .
Carefully , he undid the bow .
`` How come your bows is always cockeyed '' ? ?
She turned and put her arms around his neck .
`` I don't want to leave here , Winston '' .
`` Now listen to that '' .
He drew back , embarrassed and pleased .
`` I thought you was sick to death of this big house .
Said you wore yourself out , cleaning all these empty rooms '' .
`` At least there is room here '' , she said .
`` What room is there going to be in an apartment for any child '' ? ?
`` I told you what Miss Ada's doctor said '' .
`` I don't mean Miss Ada ! !
What you think I care about that ? ?
I mean our children '' .
She sounded as though they already existed .
In spite of the hundred things he had on his mind , Winston went and put his arm around her waist .
`` We've got plenty of time to think about that .
All the time in the world .
We've only been married four years , January '' .
`` Four years '' ! !
She wailed .
`` That's a long time , waiting '' .
`` How many times have I told you '' -- he began , and was almost glad when she cut him off -- `` Too many times '' ! !
-- and flounced to the sink , where she began noisily to wash her hands .
Too many times was the truth of it , Winston thought .
He hardly believed his reason himself any more .
Although it had seemed a good reason , to begin with : no couple could afford to have children .
`` How you going to work with a child hanging on you '' ? ?
He asked Leona .
`` You want to keep this job , don't you '' ? ?
He doubted whether she heard him , over the running water .
He sat for a while with his hands on his knees , watching the bend of her back as she gathered up her things -- a comb , a bottle of aspirin -- to take upstairs and pack .
She made him sad some days , and he was never sure why ; ;
it was something to do with her back , the thinness of it , and the quick , jerky way she bent .
She was too young , that was all ; ;
too young and thin and straight .
`` Winston '' ! !
It was Mr. Jack , bellowing out in the hall .
Winston hurried through the swinging door .
`` I've been bursting my lungs for you '' , Mr. Jack complained .
He was standing in front of the mirror , tightening his tie .
He had on his gray tweed overcoat and his city hat , and his brief case lay on the bench .
`` I don't know what you think you've been doing about my clothes '' , he said .
`` This coat looks like a rag heap '' .
There were a few blades of lint on the shoulder .
Winston took the clothesbrush out of the closet and went to work .
He gave Mr. Jack a real going-over ; ;
he brushed his shoulders and his back and his collar with long , firm strokes .
`` Hey '' ! !
Mr. Jack cried when the brush tipped his hat down over his eyes .
Winston apologized and quickly set the hat right .
Then he stood back to look at Mr. Jack , who was pulling on his pigskin gloves .
Winston enjoyed seeing him start out ; ;
he wore his clothes with style .
When he was going to town , nothing was good enough -- he had cursed at Winston once for leaving a fleck of polish on his shoelace .
At home , he wouldn't even wash his hands for supper , and he wandered around the yard in a pair of sweaty old corduroys .
The velvet smoking jackets , pearl-gray , wine , and blue , which Miss Ada had bought him hung brushed and unworn in the closet .
`` Good-by , Winston '' , Mr. Jack said , giving a final set to his hat .
`` Look out for those movers '' ! !
Winston watched him hurry down the drive to his car ; ;
a handsome , fine-looking man it made him proud to see .
After Mr. Jack drove away , Winston went on looking out the window .
He noticed a speck of dirt on the sill and swiped at it with his finger .
Then he looked at his finger , at the wrinkled , heavy knuckle and the thick nail he used like a knife to pry up , slit , and open .
For the first time , he be sad about the move .
That house was ten years off his life let himself .
Each brass handle and hinge shone for his reward , and he knew how to get at the dust in the china flowers and how to take down the long glass drops which hung from the chandelier .
He knew the house like a blind man , through his fingers , and he did not like to think of all the time and rags and polishes he had spent on keeping it up .
Ten years ago , he had come to the house to be interviewed .
The tulips and the big pink peonies had been blooming along the drive , and he had walked up from the bus almost singing .
Miss Ada had been out back , in a straw hat , planting flowers .
She had talked to him right there , with the hot sun in his face , which made him sweat and feel ashamed .
Winston had been surprised at her for that .
Still , he had liked the way she had looked , in a fresh , neat cotton dress -- citron yellow , if he remembered .
She had had a dignity about her , even barefoot and almost too tan .
Since then , the flowers she had planted had spread all over the hill .
Already the jonquils were blooming in a flock by the front gate , and the periwinkles were coming on , blue by the porch steps .
In a week the hyacinths would spike out .
And the dogwood in early May , for Miss Ada's alfresco party ; ;
and after that the Japanese cherries .
Now the yard looked wet and bald , the trees bare under their buds , but in a while Miss Ada's flowers would bloom like a marching parade .
She had dug a hole for each bulb , each tree wore a tag with her writing on it ; ;
where would she go for her gardening now ? ?
Somehow Winston didn't think she'd take to window boxes .
Sighing , he hurried to the living room .
He had a thousand things to see to .
Still , he couldn't help thinking , we're all getting old , getting small ; ;
the snail is pulling in her horns .
In the living room , Miss Ada was standing by the window with a sheaf of lists in her hand .
She was looking out at the garden .
`` Winston '' , she said , `` get the basket for the breakables '' .
Winston had the big straw basket ready in the hall .
He brought it in and put it down beside her .
Miss Ada was looking fine ; ;
she had on her Easter suit , blue , with lavender binding .
Halfway across the house , he could have smelled her morning perfume .
It hung in all her day clothes , sweet and strong ; ;
sometimes when he was pressing , Winston raised her dresses to his face .
Frowning , Miss Ada studied the list .
`` Well , let's see .
The china lemon tree .
The alabaster cockatoo '' .
Winston followed her around the room , collecting the small frail objects ( Christmas , birthday , and anniversary ) and wrapping them in tissue paper .
Neither of them trusted the movers .
When they came to Mr. Jack's photograph , twenty by twelve inches in a curly silver frame , Miss Ada said , `` By rights I ought to leave that , seeing he won't take my clotheshorse '' .
She smiled at Winston , and he saw the hateful hard glitter in her eyes .
He picked up the photograph and began to wrap it .
`` At least you could leave it for the movers '' , Miss Ada said .
`` What possessed you to tell me a clotheshorse would be a good idea '' ? ?
Winston folded the tissue paper carefully .
`` He's used it every day ; ;
every morning , I lay out his clothes on it '' .
`` Well , that's over now .
And it was his main present ! !
Leave that fool picture out '' , she added sharply .
Winston laid it in the basket .
`` Mr. Jack sets store by that '' .
`` Really , Winston .
It was meant to be my present '' .
But she went on down the list .
Winston was relieved ; ;
those presents had been on his mind .
He had only agreed with Miss Ada about getting the valet , but he had actually suggested the photograph to Mr. Jack .
`` You know what she likes , Winston '' , he had said wearily , one evening in November when Winston was pulling off his overshoes .
`` Tell me what to get her for Christmas '' .
`` She's been talking about a picture '' , Winston had told him .
`` Picture ! !
You mean picture of me '' ? ?
But Winston had persuaded him .
On Christmas night , they had had a disagreement about it .
Winston had heard because he was setting up the liquor tray in the next room .
Through the door , he had seen Mr. Jack walking around , waiting for Miss Ada .
Finally she had come down ; ;
Winston had heard her shaking out the skirt of her new pink silk hostess gown .
`` How do you like it '' ? ?
She had asked .
Mr. Jack had said , `` You look about fifteen years old '' .
`` Is that a compliment '' ? ?
`` I don't know '' .
He had stood at a little distance , studying her , as though he would walk around next and look at the back of her head .
`` Lovie , you make me feel naked '' .
Miss Ada had giggled , and she went sweeping and rustling to the couch and sank down .
`` You look like that picture I have at the office '' , Mr. Jack had started .
`` Not a line , not a wrinkle .
I look like an old man , compared '' , and he had picked up his photograph with the red Christmas bow still on it .
`` Look , an old man .
Will you wear pink when you're sixty '' ? ?
`` Darling , I love that photograph .
I'm going to put it on my dresser '' .
`` I guess it's children make a woman old .
A man gets old anyhow '' .
After a minute he went on , `` People must think the curse is on me , seeing you fresh as an apple and me old and gray '' .
`` I'll give you a medical certificate , framed , if you like '' , Miss Ada had said .
`` No .
All I want is a picture -- with a few lines .
Make the man put them in if he has to '' .
After that they had sat for five minutes without saying a word .
