`` If we left one we'd have to wipe it for fingerprints .
Here's the picture we want to leave for the fuzz -- whenever the body gets found .
This happened in the middle of a drinking bout with another bum .
If they'd been working on a bottle or a jug he'd have taken it with him '' .
`` Right .
And he'd have taken the weapon with him too , so we take that .
Now '' -- He looked around .
`` I've been careful about fingerprints .
How about you '' ? ?
`` Same .
There are the boards over the window , of course , but they're not painted and too rough to take prints .
Same goes for the rough cement of the ledge .
Besides , I doubt if the cops will even try dusting .
They find dead winos every day , maybe they won't even autopsy him for the cause of death '' .
`` We can't take a chance on that .
We've got to assume they'll decide he was murdered and we've got to keep the picture consistent .
Our hypothetical other bum who killed him would have turned out his pockets .
Let's do that '' .
We did that and found a dirty handkerchief , some matches and fourteen cents in change .
We took the matches -- they were book matches and once they'd been touched might retain fingerprints -- and the change .
We discussed the candle and decided the hypothetical other bum would have left it burning to light his way to the window and because he'd have no reason to blow it out .
The candle had been stuck on a tin lid so it wouldn't set fire to the crate when it guttered out .
A fire wouldn't have mattered except that it would cause Pops to be found sooner .
He might not be found for days , even weeks , otherwise .
We went once more over every point , then triple-checked .
Being picked up for questioning by a cop on the way out seemed to be the only possible remaining danger , and we weren't picked up by a cop .
In fact , nobody saw us , cop or citizen .
Winsett is a quiet street with no taverns and was completely deserted at that hour .
Which , if it matters , was one A.M. .
Less than three hours ago we'd decided , in Maxine Wells's pad on Cosmo , to commit a trial murder .
It had gone like clockwork .
Almost too smoothly , I found myself thinking , and then told myself that was ridiculous .
How safe is too safe ? ?
Thinking like that can get you into a padded pad .
An hour later we were back in my unpadded pad , killing what had been left of the second pint .
We decided to leave the third one intact for tomorrow .
Also our plans for me to commit Charlie's murder and for him to commit mine .
But we were really going to do it .
We shook hands on it .
We planned ahead only one step , a rendezvous for tomorrow when we could swap notes .
I'd tell him everything I'd learned about Seaton's habits and habitat , and he'd tell me the score on Radic .
We made the date for two o'clock in the afternoon at Maxine Wells's pad .
Charlie would get there early because he had the key .
From here on in , the less Charlie and I were seen together in public , or visited one another's rooms , the better .
I was dead tired and slept soundly , as far as I know dreamlessly .
We met at Maxine's and decided we were set to stay as long as it took , into or even through the evening , to talk things out .
Charlie had brought food and we'd decided on no drinks .
I'd brought along the virgin pint from last night , but we were going to kill that only when we were through talking .
I talked first , telling him everything I knew about Seaton and his house and domestic arrangements .
I drew diagrams and floor plans ; ;
he memorized them thoroughly and then we tore them into tiny pieces and flushed them down .
He gave me equivalent and even more detailed dope on Radic , including diagrams -- one of the apartment building Radic lived in and one of the apartment itself .
He'd been there several times , back when , while he and Radic had been friends , or at least not enemies .
It didn't take us as long as we'd thought it might ; ;
it was not quite six o'clock when we finished and Charlie said , `` Well , I guess that's it .
Shall we flip a coin to see which of us goes first ? ?
Or would you rather deal a hand of show-down poker or play a game of gin rummy , or what '' ? ?
`` Wait a minute , Charlie '' , I said .
`` One thing we haven't discussed , expense money .
We'll need some at least , if only bus fare to the scene of the crime .
And if you're as flat broke as I am , I think we'll have to take the added risk of knocking over a filling station or something before we split for one of us to set up an alibi while the other does his dirty work '' .
He sighed .
`` All right , I'll come clean .
I've got a little stashed for a rainy day , and I guess this is rainy enough .
A couple of hundred .
If you draw the short straw I'll lend you some bread , like fifty bucks , before I take off to visit my sister in Frisco .
Then , after I'm back , another fifty so you can put some mileage on yourself and have a solid alibi somewhere while I take care of your seat cover boy '' .
`` Solid '' , I said .
I took a deep breath , and the plunge .
`` In that case , let's not draw .
I'll go to bat first .
You'd have to wait till Seaton's back from Mexico City and also while I set it up with Doris to have her have an alibi for D-night .
So it wouldn't be for days or even a week before you could do anything .
But your friend Manny can go any time '' .
He grinned and clapped me on the shoulder .
`` I was hoping you'd say that , Willy .
But I wouldn't have suggested it .
Well -- in that case , I take off tomorrow morning for Frisco .
And , in case , I brought the money with me '' .
