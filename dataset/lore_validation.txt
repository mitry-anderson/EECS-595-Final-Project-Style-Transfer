Lou Gehrig was given the nickname Buster , and he ran Ruth a close race in home runs .
But the nickname never stuck and Gehrig was no match for Ruth in `` color '' -- which is sometimes a polite word for delinquent behavior on and off the field .
Ruth was a delinquent boy still , but he was in every way a great ball player who was out to win the game and occasionally risked a cracked bone to do it .
A few professional baseball players cultivated eccentricities , with the encouragement of the press , so that they might see their names in big black print , along with Daddy Browning's , Al Capone's , Earl Sande's , and the Prince of Wales' .
One who , for a time , succeeded best and was still the sorriest of all was Charles Arthur Shires , who called himself , in the newspapers , Art the Great , or The Great Shires .
It was his brag that he could beat everybody at anything , but especially at fighting , and he once took on the manager of his club and worked him over thoroughly with his fists .
He was given to public carousing and to acting the clown on the diamond ; ;
and a policeman asserted he had found a pair of brass knuckles in Art's pocket once when he had occasion to collar the Great First Baseman for some forgotten reason .
( This made a sportswriter named Pegler wonder in print if Art had worn this armament when he defeated his manager .
) The sorry fact about this young man , who was barely of age when he broke into major-league baseball , was that he really was a better ball player than he was given credit for being -- never so good as he claimed , and always an irritant to his associates , but a good steady performer when he could fight down the temptation to orate on his skills or cut up in public .
In his minor way Charles Arthur Shires was perhaps more typical of his era than Ruth was , for he was but one of many young men who laid waste their talents in these Scott Fitzgerald days for the sake of earning space in the newspapers .
There were others who climbed flagpoles and refused to come down ; ;
or who ingested strange objects , like live fish ; ;
or who undertook to set records for remaining erect on a dance floor , with or without a partner ; ;
or who essayed to down full bottles of illicit gin without pausing for breath .
One young man , exhilarated to the point of insanity by liquor and the excitement of the moment , performed a perfect swan dive out of the stands at the Yale Bowl during the Yale-Army football game , landed squarely on his head on the concrete ramp below , and died at once .
But the twenties were not all insanity and a striving after recognition .
The business of baseball began to prosper along with other entertainments , and performers -- thanks partly to George Herman Ruth's spectacular efforts each season to run his salary higher and higher -- prospered too .
While fifty years before , Albert Goodwill Spalding , secretary of the Chicago Ball Club of the National League , could write earnestly to the manager of the Buffalo club and request a guarantee of one hundred dollars for a baseball game in August , in this Golden Era a game at the Yankee Stadium might bring in nearly a hundred thousand dollars at the gate .
And while less than ten years earlier the wayward Black Sox -- all of them top performers in their positions -- had toiled for stingy Charles Comiskey at salaries ranging from twenty-five hundred dollars to forty-five hundred dollars a year , stars now were asking ten thousand dollars , twenty thousand dollars , yes , even fifty thousand dollars a season .
The greatest team of this period was unquestionably the New York Yankees , bought by brewery millions and made into a ball club by men named Ed Barrow and Miller Huggins .
Boston fans sometimes liked to wring some wry satisfaction out of the fact that most of the great 1923-27 crew were graduates of the Red Sox -- sold to millionaires Huston and Ruppert by a man who could not deny them their most trifling desire .
Ruth himself , still owning his farm in Massachusetts and an interest in the Massachusetts cigar business that printed his round boyish face on the wrappers , had led the parade down from Fenway Park , followed by pitchers Carl Mays , Leslie `` Joe '' Bush , Waite Hoyt , Herb Pennock , and Sam Jones , catcher Wally Schang , third baseman Joe Dugan ( who completed the `` playboy trio '' of Ruth , Dugan , and Hoyt ) , and shortstop Everett Scott .
By 1926 , when the mighty Yanks were at their mightiest , only a few of these were left but they still shone brightest , even beside able and agile rookies like Tony Lazzeri ( who managed never to have one of his epileptic fits on the field ) , Mark Koenig , Lou Gehrig , George Pipgras , and gray-thatched Earl Combs .
The deeds of this team , through two seasons and in the two World's Series that followed , have been written and talked about until hardly a word is left to be said .
But there is one small episode that a few New York fans who happened to sit in the cheap seats for one World's Series game in 1926 like best to recall .
Babe Ruth , as he always did in the Stadium , played right field to avoid having the sun in his eyes , and Tommy Thevenow , a rather mediocre hitter who played shortstop for the St. Louis Cardinals , knocked a ball with all his might into the sharp angle formed by the permanent stands and the wooden bleachers , where Ruth could not reach it .
The ball lay there , shining white on the grass in view of nearly every fan in the park while Ruth , red-necked with frustration , charged about the small patch of ground screaming , `` Where's the -- -ing ball '' ? ?
But , as he snarled unhappily when the inning was over , `` not a sonofabitch in the place would tell me '' , so little Tommy ran all the way home .
The ordinary man and woman , however , saw little of the great professional games of those Golden Days , or of any other sporting event for that matter .
Promoters always hastened to place their choice tickets in the hands of the wealthy speculators , and only the man who knew the man who knew the fellow who had an in with the guy at the box office ever came up with a good seat for a contest of any importance .
Radio broadcasts , however -- now that even plain people could afford `` loud speakers '' on their sets -- held old fans to the major-league races and attracted new ones , chiefly women , who through what the philosopher called the ineluctable modality of audition , became first inured , then attracted , then addicted to the long afternoon recitals of the doings in some distant baseball park .
In some cities games were broadcast throughout the week and then on weekends the announcer was silenced , and fans must needs drive to the city from all the broadcast area to discover how their heroes were faring .
This had a pleasant effect upon the Sunday gate receipts as well as upon the intake of the rail and bus companies , some of which began to offer special excursion rates , including seats at the park , just as the trolley and ferry companies had when baseball was new .
While women had always attended ball games in small numbers ( it was the part of a `` dead game sport '' in the early years of the twentieth century to be taken out to the ball park and to root , root , root for the home team ) , they had often sat in patient martyrdom , unable even to read the scoreboard , which sometimes seemed to indicate that one team led another by a score of three hundred and eighty to one hundred and fifty-one .
The questions women asked at baseball games were standard grist for amateur comedy , as were the doings of women automobile drivers ; ;
for every grown man ( except a few who were always suspected of being shy on virility ) knew at least the fundamentals of baseball , just as every male American in this era liked to imagine ( or pretend ) that he could fight with his fists .
And women were not expected to know that the pitcher was trying not to let the batter hit the ball .
Radio , however , so increased the interest of women in the game that it was hardly necessary even to have `` Ladies' Days '' any longer to enable men to get to the ball park without interference at home .
Women actually began to appear unaccompanied in the stands , where they still occasionally ran the risk of coming home with a tobacco-juice stain on a clean skirt or a new curse word tingling their ears .
The radio broadcasts themselves were often so patiently informative , despite the baseball jargon , that girls and women could begin to store up in their minds the same sort of random and meaningless statistics that small boys had long learned better than they ever did their lessons in school .
This conclusion is dependent on the assumption that traditional sex mores will continue to sanction both premarital chastity as the `` ideal '' , and the double standard holding females primarily responsible for preserving the ideal .
Our discussion of this involves using Erik Erikson's schema of `` identity vs. identity diffusion '' as a conceptual tool in superimposing a few common denominators onto the diverse personality and family configurations of the unwed mothers from whose case histories we quoted earlier .
Our discussion does not utilize all the identity crises postulated by Erikson , but is intended to demonstrate the utility of his theoretical schema for studying unwed mothers .
We hope thereby to emphasize that , from a psychological standpoint , the effectual prevention of illegitimacy is a continuous long-term process involving the socialization of the female from infancy through adolescence .
Hypothesizing a series of developmental stages that begin in the individual's infancy and end in his old age , Erikson has indicated that the adolescent is faced with a series of identity crises .
The successful and positive resolution of these crises during adolescence involves an epigenetic principle -- during adolescence , the individual's positive resolutions in each area of identity crisis depend , to a considerable degree , on his already having resolved preliminary and preparatory identity crises during his infancy , childhood , and early adolescence .
Within Erikson's schema , the adolescent's delinquent behavior -- in this case , her unwed motherhood -- reflects her `` identity diffusion '' , or her inability to resolve these various identity crises positively .
The adolescent experiences identity crises in terms of time perspective vs. time diffusion .
Time perspective -- the ability to plan for the future and to postpone gratifying immediate wants in order to achieve long-range objectives -- is more easily developed if , from infancy on , the individual has been able to rely on and trust people and the world in which she lives .
Erikson has noted that , unless this trust developed early , the time ambivalence experienced , in varying degree and temporarily , by all adolescents ( as a result of their remembering the more immediate gratification of wants during childhood , while not yet having fully accepted the long-range planning required by adulthood ) may develop into a more permanent sense of time diffusion .
Experience of this time diffusion ranges from a sense of utter apathy to a feeling of desperate urgency to act immediately .
These polar extremes in time diffusion were indicated in some of the comments by unwed mothers reported in earlier chapters .
Some of these mothers , apparently feeling a desperate urgency , made , on the spur of the moment , commitments , in love and sex , that would have life-long consequences .
Others displayed utter apathy and indifference to any decision about the past or the future .
For many of these unwed mothers , the data on their family life and early childhood experiences revealed several indications and sources of their basic mistrust of their parents in particular and of the world in general .
However , as Erickson has noted , the individual's failure to develop preliminary identities during infancy and childhood need not be irreversibly deterministic with respect to a given area of identity diffusion in his ( or her ) adolescence .
And , as shown in Chapter 6 , , some SNP females originally developed such trust only during their adolescence , through the aid of , and their identification with , alter-parents .
In the specific case of time diffusion , we must emphasize the significance of the earlier development of mistrust when it is combined with the inevitable time crisis experienced by most ( if not all ) adolescents in our society , and with the failure of the adolescent period to provide opportunities for developing trust .
The adolescent experiences two closely related crises : self-certainty vs. an identity consciousness ; ;
and role-experimentation vs. negative identity .
A sense of self-certainty and the freedom to experiment with different roles , or confidence in one's own unique behavior as an alternative to peer-group conformity , is more easily developed during adolescence if , during early childhood , the individual was permitted to exercise initiative and encouraged to develop some autonomy .
However , if the child has been constantly surrounded , during nursery and early school age , by peer groups ; ;
inculcated with the primacy of group acceptance and group standards ; ;
and allowed little initiative in early play and work patterns -- then in adolescence her normal degree of vanity , sensitivity , and preoccupation with whether others find her appearance and behavior acceptable , will be compounded .
Her ostensible indifference to and rebellion against suggestions and criticisms by anyone except peer friends during adolescence are the manifestations , in her adolescence , of her having been indoctrinated in childhood to feel shame , if not guilt , for failing to behave in a manner acceptable to , and judged by , the performance of her nursery- and elementary-school peer friends .
To be different is to invite shame and doubt ; ;
and it is better to be shamed and criticized by one's parents , who already consider one different and difficult to understand , than by one's peers , who are also experiencing a similar groping for and denial of adult status .
The attitudes of some unwed mothers quoted in Chapter 2 , , revealed both considerable preoccupation with being accepted by others and a marked absence of self-certainty .
Many appeared to regard their sexual behavior as a justifiable means of gaining acceptance from and identification with others ; ;
but very few seemed aware that such acceptance and identification need to be supplemented with more enduring and stable identification of and with one's self .
Another identity crisis confronting the adolescent involves anticipation of achievement vs. work-paralysis .
The adolescent's capacity to anticipate achievement and to exercise the self-discipline necessary to complete tasks successfully depends on the degree to which he or she developed autonomy , initiative , and self-discipline during childhood .
The developmental process involves the individual's progressively experiencing a sense of dignity and achievement resulting from having completed tasks , having kept commitments , and having created something ( however small or simple -- even a doll dress of one's own design rather than in the design `` it ought to be '' ) .
These childhood experiences are sources of the self-certainty that the adolescent needs , for experimenting with many roles , and for the freedom to fail sometimes in the process of exploring and discovering her skills and abilities .
If she has not had such experiences , the female's normal adolescent degree of indecision will be compounded .
She may well be incapacitated by it when she is confronted with present and future alternatives -- e.g. , whether to prepare primarily for a career or for the role of a homemaker ; ;
whether to stay financially dependent on her parents or help support herself while attending school ; ;
whether to pursue a college education or a job after high school ; ;
and whether to attend this or that college and to follow this or that course of study .
Erikson has noted that , as this indecision mounts , it may result in a `` paralysis of workmanship '' .
This paralysis may be expressed in the female's starting -- and never completing -- many jobs , tasks , and courses of study ; ;
and in the fact that she bases her decisions about work , college , carreer , and studies on what others are doing , rather than on her own sense of identity with given skills , abilities , likes , and dislikes .
The absence , during her childhood and early adolescence , of experiences in developing the self-discipline to complete tasks within her ability -- experiences that would have been subsequent sources of anticipation of achievement -- and her lack of childhood opportunities to practice autonomy and initiative in play and expression , both tend in her adolescence to deprive her of the freedoms to role-experiment and to fail occasionally in experimenting .
The comments made by some unwed mothers ( quoted in Chapter 2 ) ) reflect this paralysis of workmanship .
They attended school and selected courses primarily on the basis of decisions others made ; ;
they accepted a job primarily because it was available , convenient , and paid reasonably .
These things both express and , at the same time , continue contributing to , their identity diffusion in an area that could have become a source of developing dignity and self-certainty .
As their identity diffusion increased , they became more susceptible to sporadic diversions in love and sexual affairs .
These affairs temporarily relieved the monotony of school or work activities containing no anticipation of achievement and joy of craftsmanship , no sense of dignity derived from a job well done .
Childhood experiences in learning work and self-discipline habits within a context of developing autonomy and initiative have considerable significance for the prevention of illegitimacy .
The excerpts from case histories presented above confirm this significance , though through different facets of experience .
For example , some unwed mothers had had no work experiences , household chores , and responsibilities during childhood and early adolescence ; ;
they subsequently occupied their leisure hours in searching for something exciting and diverting .
Sex was both .
On the other hand , some unwed mothers had had so much work and responsibility imposed on them at an early age , and had thus had so little freedom or opportunity to develop autonomy and initiative , that their work and responsibilities became dull and unrewarding burdens -- to be escaped and rebelled against through fun and experimentation with forbidden sexual behavior .
The adolescent also faces the identity crisis that Erikson has termed ideological polarization vs. diffusion of ideals .
In discussing the ways this crisis is germane to consderations for the prevention of illegitimacy , we shall again superimpose Erikson's concept on our data .
Adolescents have a much-discussed tendency to polarize ideas and values , to perceive things as `` either-or '' , black or white -- nuances of meaning are relatively unimportant .
This tendency is , perhaps , most clearly revealed in the literature on religious conversions and experiences of adolescents .
Erikson has postulated that such ideological polarization temporarily resolves their search for something stable and definite in the rapidly changing and fluctuating no-man's-land between childhood and adulthood .
It provides identification -- with an idea , a value , a cause that cuts through , or even transcends , the multiple and ambivalent identities of their passage from child to adult , and permits their forceful and overt expression of emotion .
The positive development , during adolescence , of this capacity to think and to feel strongly and with increasing independence , and to identify overtly either with or against given ideas , values , and practices , depends to a considerable degree on both previous and present opportunities for developing autonomy , initiative , and self-certainty .
Most adolescents have some ideological diffusion at various developmental stages , as they experience a proliferation of ideas and values .
The diffusion is most pronounced and most likely to become fixed , however , in those who have had no or very minimal opportunities to develop the autonomy and initiative that could have been directed into constructive expression and so served as sources of developing self-certainty .
A pronounced ideological diffusion -- i.e. , inability to identify independently with given ideas and value systems -- is reflected in many ways .
For example , it is evinced by the adolescent ( or adult ) whose beliefs and actions represent primarily his rebellion and reaction against the ideas and behavior patterns of others , rather than his inner conviction and choice .
It is mirrored by the individual Willie Lohmans , whose ideas and behavior patterns are so dependent and relativistic that they always coincide with those of the individual or group present and most important at the moment .
In another sense , it is represented in the arguments of the `` true believers '' who seek to disprove the validity of all other beliefs and ideas in order to retain confidence in theirs .
The case histories provide some interesting illustrations of ideological diffusion , embodied in the unwed mother's inability to identify independently a given value system or behavior pattern , , and her subsequent disinclination to assume any individual responsibility for her sexual behavior .
For example , the unwed mothers expressed their frustration with males who did not indicate more explicitly `` what it is they really want from a girl so one can act accordingly '' .
They were disappointed by the physical and emotional hurt of premarital sexual intercourse .
They condemned the movie script writers for implying that sex was enjoyable and exhilarating .
They criticized parents for never having emphasized traditional concepts of right and wrong ; ;
and they censured parents who `` never disciplined and were too permissive '' or who `` never explained how easy it was to get pregnant '' .
In the adult world , there are a number of rather general and diffuse sources of ideological diffusion that further compound the adolescent's search for meaning during this particular identity crisis .
For example , some contemporary writing tends to fuse the `` good guys '' and the `` bad guys '' , to portray the weak people as heroes and weakness as a virtue , and to explain ( or even justify ) asocial behavior by attributing it to deterministic psychological , familial , and social experiences .
In the final accounting , these would have augmented the bill for both sides .
An estimate of one million dollars is probably not excessive .
Yet the huge amount of money consumed by the Selden litigation , which many regarded as wasteful , indirectly contributed to constructive changes in legal procedure .
The duration and other circumstances of the Selden case made it a flagrant example of the gross abuses of patent infringement actions .
The suit , as we have seen , came before the courts when patent attorneys , inventors , and laymen were making mounting demands for reforms in the American patent system .
Chief among the defects they singled out were the complicated and wearisome procedures in equity .
In a long and angry footnote to his opinion , Judge Hough had lent the weight of judicial condemnation to such criticism .
`` It is a duty '' , said Hough , `` not to let pass this opportunity of protesting against the methods of taking and printing testimony in Equity , current in this circuit ( and probably others ) , excused if not justified by the rules of the Supreme Court , especially to be found in patent causes , and flagrantly exemplified in this litigation .
As long as the bar prefers to adduce evidence by written deposition , rather than viva voce before an authoritative judicial officer , I fear that the antiquated rules will remain unchanged , and expensive prolixity remain the best known characteristic of Equity '' .
Observing that `` reforms sometimes begin with the contemplation of horrible examples '' , Hough catalogued the many abuses encouraged by existing procedures .
He cited the elephantine dimensions of the Selden case record ; ;
the duplication of testimony and exhibits ; ;
the numerous squabbles over minor matters ; ;
the `` objections stated at outrageous length '' ; ;
and the frequent and rancorous verbal bouts , `` uncalled for and unjustifiable , from the retort discourteous to the lie direct '' .
The fundamental difficulty of which the Selden case was `` a striking ( though not singular ) example '' , concluded Hough , `` will remain as long as testimony is taken without any authoritative judicial officer present , and responsible for the maintenance of discipline , and the reception or exclusion of testimony '' .
Not least among the members of the patent bar who echoed this powerful indictment were those who had participated in the Selden suit .
William A. Redding asserted that if the case had been heard in open court under rules of evidence , the testimony would have been completed in sixty days instead of five years .
Inventors joined lawyers in the clamor for reform , inevitably centering upon the Selden litigation as a `` horrible example '' .
Its costive deliberations were likened to those of the British courts of chancery mercilessly caricatured by Dickens in Bleak House .
Parker , who agreed with much of this criticism , did not conceal his dissatisfaction with procedural defects .
But he felt that the Selden case was being unfairly pilloried .
In a detailed letter published in the Scientific American in 1912 , he remarked that `` loose statements '' about the case showed scant understanding of the facts .
The suit , although commonly designated as a single action , actually embraced five cases .
Parker insisted that the size of the record would have been drastically reduced but for an unavoidable duplication of testimony .
In a private communication written in 1911 , Parker had been more to the point .
Noting the complaints of inventors and members of the patent bar , he admitted that some of the strictures `` were fairly well founded '' , but he added that under existing rules the courts could not consolidate testimony in a group of suits involving separate infringements of the same patent .
The vast industrial interests caught up in the Selden suit , as well as the complex character of the automotive art , encouraged both sides to exploit `` every possible chance '' for or against the patent , said Parker .
`` This very seldom happens in this class or in other cases , and of course all of these matters led to a volume and an expense of the record beyond what ordinarily would occur '' .
Parker listed the remedies he deemed essential for reducing the cost and mass of testimony .
The most important of these found him in agreement with Hough's plea for reform .
Parker called for abolition of the indiscriminate or uncontrolled right of taking depositions before officers of the court who had no authority to limit testimony .
The taking of depositions , he suggested , should be placed under a special court examiner empowered to compel responsive and relevant answers and to exclude immaterial testimony .
`` I am satisfied that in the Selden case had this power existed and this course ( been ) pursued , it would have shortened the depositions of some of the experts nearly one-half and of some of the other witnesses thereto more than that '' .
In the end Hough's acidulous protest , which Parker called the `` now somewhat famous note on this ' Selden ' case '' , did not go unheeded .
In 1912 the United States Supreme Court adopted a new set of rules of equity which became effective on February 1 , 1913 .
The revised procedure was acclaimed as a long-overdue reform .
Under the new rules , testimony is taken orally in open court in all cases except those of an extraordinary character .
Other expeditious methods are designed to prevent prolixity , limit delays , and reduce the expense of infringement suits .
One of the A.L.A.M. lawyers observed that if the Selden case had been tried under this simplified procedure , the testimony which filled more than a score of volumes , `` at a minimum cost of $1 a page for publication alone , could have been contained in one volume '' .
While patent suits are still among the most complex and expensive forms of litigation , these rules have saved litigants uncounted sums of money .
There is little doubt that they were promulgated by the Supreme Court as a direct result of the Selden patent suit .

.
Even before it was formally dissolved in 1912 , the A.L.A.M. was succeeded by the Automobile Board of Trade , the direct lineal ancestor of the present-day Automobile Manufacturers Association .
The trade bodies which came in the wake of the A.L.A.M. were more representative , for they never adopted a policy of exclusion .
Nevertheless , it is from the Selden organization that the industry inherited its institutional machinery for furthering the broader interests of the trade .
One of the chief features of this community of interest is the automotive patents cross-licensing agreement , a milestone in the development of American industrial cooperation .
Its origin lies in the Selden patent controversy and its aftermath .
From the earliest days of the motor car industry , before the A.L.A.M. was established , patent infringement loomed as a serious and vexing problem .
Many patent contests were waged over automobile components and accessories , among them tires , detachable rims , ball bearings , license brackets , and electric horns .
The fluidity and momentum of the young industry abetted a general disregard of patent claims .
As early as 1900 a Wall Street combination acquired detail patents with the intention of exacting heavy tribute from automobile manufacturers .
This scheme failed , and the following decade brought a deluge of infringement suits among individual manufacturers that reached its crest in 1912 .
In this tangle of conflicting claims , the patent-sharing scheme adopted by the A.L.A.M. at its founding proved to be the best device for avoiding or mitigating the burdens of incessant litigation .
The interchange of shop licenses for a nominal royalty eliminated infringement suits among the members of the A.L.A.M. patent pool ( although it did not protect them against outside actions ) and kept open channels for the cross-fertilization of automotive technology .
One of the conditions of the pool was a prohibition upon the withholding of patent rights among A.L.A.M. members .
Within its limits , this arrangement had the actual or potential characteristics of a cross-licensing agreement .
Its positive features outweighed the fact that the pool was an adjunct of a wouldbe monopoly .
Since the A.L.A.M. holdings embraced only about twenty-five per cent of motor vehicle patents , the denial of rights to independent companies did not retard technical progress in unlicensed sectors of the industry .
The highly important Dyer patents on the sliding gear transmission were held by the A.L.A.M. pool .
But Henry Ford used the planetary transmission in his Model T and earlier cars and , in 1905 , as a precautionary measure , took out a license from the man who claimed to be its inventor .
For those affiliated with it , the A.L.A.M. pool was a haven from the infringement actions involving detail patents that beset the industry with mounting intensity after 1900 .
By 1910 the courts were crowded with cases , many of them brought by freebooters who trafficked in disputed inventions .
It was commonplace for auto makers , parts-suppliers , and dealers to find warning notices and threats of infringement suits in their daily mail .
`` Purely from the business man's standpoint and without regard to the lawyer's view '' , commented a trade journal , `` the matter of patents in the automobile and accessory trade is developing some phases and results that challenge thought as to how far patents are to become weapons of warfare in business , instead of simple beneficient protection devices for encouraging inventive creation '' .
Occasionally new enterprise was discouraged by the almost certain prospect of legal complications .
One manufacturer who held an allegedly basic patent said : `` I would readily put over $50,000 into the manufacture of the device , but it is so easy to make that we would enter immediately into a prolonged ordeal of patent litigation which would eat up all our profits '' .
The prevailing view in the industry was summed up in 1912 by a group of auto makers who told a Senate committee : `` The exceedingly unsatisfactory and uselessly expensive conditions , including delays surrounding legal disputes , particularly in patent litigation , are items of industrial burden which must be written large in figures of many millions of dollars of industrial waste '' .
By that time it was commonly agreed that patent warfare was sapping constructive achievement and blocking the free exchange of technical information .
At this point Charles C. Hanch , long an advocate of patent peace in the industry , became chairman of the patents committee of the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce , successor to the Automobile Board of Trade .
Hanch was treasurer of the Nordyke & Marmon Company , an Indianapolis firm which had manufactured flour-milling machinery before producing the Marmon car in 1904 .
He had first-hand knowledge of the patent wars which had driven about ninety per cent of the milling equipment makers out of business in the mid-1890's .
Anxious to avoid a similar debacle in the motor car industry , Hanch went to Detroit in 1909 to enlist the support of leading A.L.A.M. members for an industry-wide patent-sharing plan .
The breach created by the Selden patent doomed his proposal , but Hanch did not abandon his scheme .
After the demise of the A.L.A.M. , the time was propitious for establishing such a pool .
Most manufacturers were now disposed to heed a proposal for the formal interchange of patents .
`` It is a much easier course to agree to let one another alone so far as ordinary patents are concerned '' , said a trade authority , `` than to continue the costly effort of straightening the tangle in the courts or seeking to reform the patent system , which appears to be getting into deeper confusion every day '' .
With the other members of the patents committee -- Wilfred C. Leland , Howard E. Coffin , Windsor T. White , and W. H. Vandervoort -- Hanch drafted a cross-licensing agreement whose essential feature of royalty-free licensing was his own contribution .
The plan was supported by Frederick P. Fish , counsel for the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce .
It will be recalled that in his summation for the A.L.A.M. before Judge Hough , Fish had condemned patent litigation as the curse of the American industrial community .
He was well aware that some inventors and their allies used their patents solely for nuisance value .
`` My personal view is that not one patented invention in ten is worth making '' , he later told a Congressional committee .
The eloquent persuasions of Fish guaranteed the adoption of the plan by the members of the automotive trade association .
Drawn up in 1914 , the cross-licensing agreement became effective in 1915 .
It remained in force for ten years and has been renewed at five-year intervals since 1925 .
A little farther along the road you come to the Church of Santa Sabina , called the `` Pearl of the Aventine '' .
Continue another hundred yards to the Piazza of the Knights of Malta .
On the wall of this square there are delightful bas-reliefs of musical instruments .
The massive gate of the Maltese villa affords one of the most extraordinary views in Rome .
If you look through the keyhole , you will see an artistically landscaped garden with the white dome of St. Peter's framed in a long avenue of cropped laurel trees .
Retrace your steps a few yards on the Via Di Santa Sabina and turn right on the Via Di S. Alessio , a street lined with stately homes .
Oleanders , cypress , and palms in the spacious gardens add much color and beauty to this attractive residential section .
Turn left a block or so before the street ends , and then turn right down the Via Di Santa Prisca to the Viale Aventino .
Here you can pick up a taxi or public transport to return to the center of the city .
The renaissance city
to the piazza Navona and pantheon
These two walks take you through the heart of Rome .
You will walk some of the narrow , old streets , hemmed in by massive palazzi .
You will visit a few churches that are exceptional yet often by-passed , a magnificent square , the main shopping district , the Spanish Steps , and the lovely Pincian Gardens .
By seeing such varied places , both interesting and beautiful , you will become aware of the many different civilizations Rome has lived through , and in particular , get a feel of Renaissance Rome .
You will realize why Rome is indeed the Eternal City .
Start on the Via D. Teatro Di Marcello at the foot of the Capitoline Hill .
The majestic circular tiers of stone of the Theatre of Marcellus give you some idea of the huge edifice that the Emperor Augustus erected in 13 B.C. .
Twenty-two thousand spectators used to crowd it in Roman days .
Andrea Palladio , an Italian architect of the sixteenth century , modeled his designs on its Doric and Ionic columns .
Wander past the three superb Columns of Apollo by the arches of the theatre .
The remains of the Portico of Octavia are now in front of you .
Climb the steps from the theatre to the Via Della Tribuna Di Campitelli for an even better view of the Columns of Apollo .
Turn to the right along a narrow street to the tiny Piazza Campitelli , then proceed along the Via Dei Funari to the Piazza Mattei .
Here is one of the loveliest fountains in Rome , the Fontana delle Tartarughe or `` Fountain of the Tortoises '' .
It's typical of Rome that in the midst of this rather poor area you should find such an artistic work in the center of a little square .
Stand here for a few moments and look at this gem of a fountain with its four youths , each holding a tortoise and each with a foot resting on the head of a dolphin .
The figures have been executed so skillfully that one senses a great feeling of life and movement .
Opposite is the Palazzo Mattei , one of Rome's oldest palaces , now the headquarters of the Italo-American Association .
Go inside for a closer look at a Renaissance palace .
In the first courtyard there are some fine bas-reliefs and friezes , and in the second a series of delightful terraced roof gardens above an ivy-covered wall .
The Palazzo Caetani , still inhabited by the Caetani family , adjoins the Palazzo Mattei .
Keep straight ahead on the Via Falegnami , cross the wide Via Arenula , and you will come to the Piazza B. Cairoli , where you should look in at the Church of San Carlo Ai Catinari to see the frescoes on the ceiling .
Follow the colorful and busy Via D. Giubbonari for a hundred yards or so .
Now turn left at the Via dell' Arco Del Monte to the Piazza Dei Pellegrini .
Just a few yards to the right on the Via Capo Di Ferro will bring you to the Palazzo Spada , built in 1540 and now occupied by the Council of State .
Paintings by Titian , Caravaggio , and Rubens are on display ( open 9:30 to 4:00 ) .
Before you enter the palazzo , note Francesco Borromini's facade .
The great architect also designed the fine interior staircase and colonnade which connects the two courts .
The large statue on the first floor is believed to be the statue of Pompey at the base of which Julius Caesar was stabbed to death ( if so , the statue once stood in the senate house ) .
( This is shown in the afternoon and on Sunday morning .
)
By tipping the porter , you can see in the courtyard Borromini's unusual and fascinating trick in perspective .
When you stand before the barrel-vaulted colonnade you have the impression that the statue at the end is at a considerable distance , yet it is actually only a few feet away .
The sense of perspective has been created by designing the length of the columns so that those at the far end of the colonnade are much shorter than those in front .
The gardens of the palazzo , shaded by a huge magnolia tree , are most attractive .
The courtyard is magnificently decorated .
From the Palazzo Spada you continue another block along the Via Capo Di Ferro and Vicolo De Venti to the imposing Palazzo Farnese , begun in 1514 and considered by many to be the finest palace of all .
Michelangelo was the most distinguished of several noted architects who helped design it .
Today it is occupied by the French Embassy .
Its lovely seventeenth-century ceiling frescoes , as well as the huge guards room with a tremendously high and beautifully carved wooden ceiling , can be seen Sundays ( 11:00 to 12:00 noon ) .
Ask to see the modern tapestries of Paris and Rome designed by Lurcat .
Directly in front of the palace along the Via D. Baullari you will come to the Campo Di Fiori , the famous site of executions during the turbulent days of Renaissance Rome .
Today , by contrast it is a lively and colorful fruit , vegetable , and flower market .
Continue on the Via D. Baullari to the Corso Vittorio Emanuele , then turn right for a couple of hundred yards to the Church of Sant' Andrea Della Valle .
As you approach the church on the Via D. Baullari you are passing within yards of the remains of the Roman Theatre of Pompey , near which is believed to have been the place where Julius Caesar was assassinated .
The dome of the church is , outside of St. Peter's , one of the largest in Rome .
Opera lovers will be interested to learn that this church was the scene for the first act of Tosca .
At this point you cross the wide Corso Vittorio Emanuele 2 , , walk along the Corso Del Rinascimento a couple of hundred yards , then turn left on the Via Dei Canestrani to enter the splendid Piazza Navona , one of the truly glorious sights in Rome .
Your first impression of this elongated square with its three elegant fountains , its two churches that almost face each other , and its russet-colored buildings , is a sense of restful spaciousness -- particularly welcome after wandering around the narrow and dark streets that you have followed since starting this walk .
The site of the oblong piazza is Domitian's ancient stadium , which was probably used for horse and chariot races .
For centuries it was the location of historic festivals and open-air sports events .
From the seventeenth to the nineteenth century it was a popular practice to flood the piazza in the summer , and the aristocrats would then ride around the inundated square in their carriages .
Giovanni Bernini's `` Fountain of the Rivers '' , in the center of the piazza , is built around a Roman obelisk from the Circus of Maxentius which rests on grottoes and rocks , with four huge figures , one at each corner , denoting four great rivers from different continents -- the Danube , the Ganges , the Nile , and the Plate .
The eyes of the figure of the Nile are covered , perhaps either to symbolize the mystery of her source or to obscure from her sight the baroque facade of the Church of Sant' Agnese in Agone , the work of Bernini's rival , Borromini .
In the Piazza Navona there are many delightful cafes where you can sit , have a drink or lunch , and watch the fountains in the square .
The scene before you is indeed theatrical and often appears in movies about Rome .
Perhaps a street musician will pass to add that extra touch .
Take the Via Di S. Agnese in Agone , next to the church and opposite the center of the square , then turn right after about two hundred yards to reach the beautiful Church of Santa Maria Della Pace .
Inside you will find the lovely Sibyls painted by Raphael and a chapel designed by Michelangelo .
The church's cloisters are among Donato Bramante's most beautiful creations .
Now return to the Piazza Navona and leave it on the opposite side by the Corsia Agonale ; ;
in a moment cross the Corso Del Rinascimento .
In front of you is the Palazzo Madama , once belonging to the Medici and now the Italian Senate .
Walk by the side of the palazzo and after two blocks along the Via Giustiniani you will come to the Piazza Della Rotonda .
You are now facing the Pantheon , the largest and best-preserved building still standing from the days of ancient Rome .
This circular edifice , constructed by Agrippa in B.C. 27 , was rebuilt in its present shape by the Emperor Hadrian .
It was dedicated as a church in the seventh century .
As you pause in the piazza by the Egyptian obelisk brought from the Temple of Isis , you will admire the Pantheon's impressive Corinthian columns .
The Pantheon's interior , still in its original form , is truly majestic and an architectural triumph .
Its rotunda forms a perfect circle whose diameter is equal to the height from the floor to the ceiling .
The only means of interior light is the twenty-nine-foot-wide aperture in the stupendous dome .
Standing before the tomb of Raphael , the great genius of the Renaissance , when shafts of sunlight are penetrating this great Roman temple , you are once again reminded of the varied civilizations so characteristic of Rome .
As you leave the Pantheon , take the narrow street to the right , the Via Del Seminario , a block to Sant' Ignazio , one of the most splendid baroque churches in the city .
( Along the way there , about one hundred yards on your right , you pass a simple restaurant , La Sacrestia , where you can have the best pizza in Rome .
) The curve of faded terra-cotta-colored houses in front of the church seems like a stage set .
This is one of the most charming little squares in this part of Rome .
One block along the Via De Burro ( in front of the church ) will bring you to the Stock Exchange in the old Temple of Neptune .
A few yards farther , on the Via Dei Bergamaschi , is the Piazza Colonna .
The great column from which the square takes its name was erected by the Emperor Marcus Aurelius .
You are now at the Corso , though narrow , one of Rome's busiest streets .
Horse races took place here in the Middle Ages .
If you have taken this stroll in the morning , and you have the time and inclination , walk to the right along the crowded Corso for half a dozen blocks to visit the fine private collection of paintings -- mainly of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries -- in the Palazzo Doria ( open Sunday , Tuesday , and Thursday , 10:00 to 1:00 ) .
Here is your opportunity to see the inside of a palazzo where the family still lives .
Otherwise , cross over the Corso and walk a block or so to the left .
You will come to Alemagna , a delightful , though moderately expensive restaurant , which is particularly noted for its exceptional selection of ice creams and patisseries .
Either here , or in one of the modest restaurants nearby , is just the place to end this first walk through the heart of Rome .
To the Spanish steps
The second walk through the heart of Rome should be taken after lunch , so that you will reach the Pincian Hill when the soft light of the late afternoon is at its best .
Rare , indeed , is the Harlem citizen , from the most circumspect church member to the most shiftless adolescent , who does not have a long tale to tell of police incompetence , injustice , or brutality .
I myself have witnessed and endured it more than once .
The businessmen and racketeers also have a story .
And so do the prostitutes .
( And this is not , perhaps , the place to discuss Harlem's very complex attitude toward black policemen , nor the reasons , according to Harlem , that they are nearly all downtown .
)
It is hard , on the other hand , to blame the policeman , blank , good-natured , thoughtless , and insuperably innocent , for being such a perfect representative of the people he serves .
He , too , believes in good intentions and is astounded and offended when they are not taken for the deed .
He has never , himself , done anything for which to be hated -- which of us has ? ?
-- and yet he is facing , daily and nightly , people who would gladly see him dead , and he knows it .
There is no way for him not to know it : there are few things under heaven more unnerving than the silent , accumulating contempt and hatred of a people .
He moves through Harlem , therefore , like an occupying soldier in a bitterly hostile country ; ;
which is precisely what , and where , he is , and is the reason he walks in twos and threes .
And he is not the only one who knows why he is always in company : the people who are watching him know why , too .
Any street meeting , sacred or secular , which he and his colleagues uneasily cover has as its explicit or implicit burden the cruelty and injustice of the white domination .
And these days , of course , in terms increasingly vivid and jubilant , it speaks of the end of that domination .
The white policeman standing on a Harlem street corner finds himself at the very center of the revolution now occurring in the world .
He is not prepared for it -- naturally , nobody is -- and , what is possibly much more to the point , he is exposed , as few white people are , to the anguish of the black people around him .
Even if he is gifted with the merest mustard grain of imagination , something must seep in .
He cannot avoid observing that some of the children , in spite of their color , remind him of children he has known and loved , perhaps even of his own children .
He knows that he certainly does not want his children living this way .
He can retreat from his uneasiness in only one direction : into a callousness which very shortly becomes second nature .
He becomes more callous , the population becomes more hostile , the situation grows more tense , and the police force is increased .
One day , to everyone's astonishment , someone drops a match in the powder keg and everything blows up .
Before the dust has settled or the blood congealed , editorials , speeches , and civil-rights commissions are loud in the land , demanding to know what happened .
What happened is that Negroes want to be treated like men .
Negroes want to be treated like men : a perfectly straightforward statement , containing only seven words .
People who have mastered Kant , Hegel , Shakespeare , Marx , Freud , and the Bible find this statement utterly impenetrable .
The idea seems to threaten profound , barely conscious assumptions .
A kind of panic paralyzes their features , as though they found themselves trapped on the edge of a steep place .
I once tried to describe to a very well-known American intellectual the conditions among Negroes in the South .
My recital disturbed him and made him indignant ; ;
and he asked me in perfect innocence , `` Why don't all the Negroes in the South move North '' ? ?
I tried to explain what has happened , unfailingly , whenever a significant body of Negroes move North .
They do not escape Jim Crow : they merely encounter another , not-less-deadly variety .
They do not move to Chicago , they move to the South Side ; ;
they do not move to New York , they move to Harlem .
The pressure within the ghetto causes the ghetto walls to expand , and this expansion is always violent .
White people hold the line as long as they can , and in as many ways as they can , from verbal intimidation to physical violence .
But inevitably the border which has divided the ghetto from the rest of the world falls into the hands of the ghetto .
The white people fall back bitterly before the black horde ; ;
the landlords make a tidy profit by raising the rent , chopping up the rooms , and all but dispensing with the upkeep ; ;
and what has once been a neighborhood turns into a `` turf '' .
This is precisely what happened when the Puerto Ricans arrived in their thousands -- and the bitterness thus caused is , as I write , being fought out all up and down those streets .
Northerners indulge in an extremely dangerous luxury .
They seem to feel that because they fought on the right side during the Civil War , and won , they have earned the right merely to deplore what is going on in the South , without taking any responsibility for it ; ;
and that they can ignore what is happening in Northern cities because what is happening in Little Rock or Birmingham is worse .
Well , in the first place , it is not possible for anyone who has not endured both to know which is `` worse '' .
I know Negroes who prefer the South and white Southerners , because `` At least there , you haven't got to play any guessing games '' ! !
The guessing games referred to have driven more than one Negro into the narcotics ward , the madhouse , or the river .
I know another Negro , a man very dear to me , who says , with conviction and with truth , `` The spirit of the South is the spirit of America '' .
He was born in the North and did his military training in the South .
He did not , as far as I can gather , find the South `` worse '' ; ;
he found it , if anything , all too familiar .
In the second place , though , even if Birmingham is worse , no doubt Johannesburg , South Africa , beats it by several miles , and Buchenwald was one of the worst things that ever happened in the entire history of the world .
The world has never lacked for horrifying examples ; ;
but I do not believe that these examples are meant to be used as justification for our own crimes .
This perpetual justification empties the heart of all human feeling .
The emptier our hearts become , the greater will be our crimes .
Thirdly , the South is not merely an embarrassingly backward region , but a part of this country , and what happens there concerns every one of us .
As far as the color problem is concerned , there is but one great difference between the Southern white and the Northerner : the Southerner remembers , historically and in his own psyche , a kind of Eden in which he loved black people and they loved him .
Historically , the flaming sword laid across this Eden is the Civil War .
Personally , it is the Southerner's sexual coming of age , when , without any warning , unbreakable taboos are set up between himself and his past .
Everything , thereafter , is permitted him except the love he remembers and has never ceased to need .
The resulting , indescribable torment affects every Southern mind and is the basis of the Southern hysteria .
None of this is true for the Northerner .
Negroes represent nothing to him personally , except , perhaps , the dangers of carnality .
He never sees Negroes .
Southerners see them all the time .
Northerners never think about them whereas Southerners are never really thinking of anything else .
Negroes are , therefore , ignored in the North and are under surveillance in the South , and suffer hideously in both places .
Neither the Southerner nor the Northerner is able to look on the Negro simply as a man .
It seems to be indispensable to the national self-esteem that the Negro be considered either as a kind of ward ( in which case we are told how many Negroes , comparatively , bought Cadillacs last year and how few , comparatively , were lynched ) , or as a victim ( in which case we are promised that he will never vote in our assemblies or go to school with our kids ) .
They are two sides of the same coin and the South will not change -- cannot change -- until the North changes .
The country will not change until it re-examines itself and discovers what it really means by freedom .
In the meantime , generations keep being born , bitterness is increased by incompetence , pride , and folly , and the world shrinks around us .
It is a terrible , an inexorable , law that one cannot deny the humanity of another without diminishing one's own : in the face of one's victim , one sees oneself .
Walk through the streets of Harlem and see what we , this nation , have become .

East River , downtown : postscript to a letter from Harlem
the fact that American Negroes rioted in the U.N. while Adlai Stevenson was addressing the Assembly shocked and baffled most white Americans .
Stevenson's speech , and the spectacular disturbance in the gallery , were both touched off by the death , in Katanga , the day before , of Patrice Lumumba .
Stevenson stated , in the course of his address , that the United States was `` against '' colonialism .
God knows what the African nations , who hold 25 per cent of the voting stock in the U.N. were thinking -- they may , for example , have been thinking of the U.S. abstention when the vote on Algerian freedom was before the Assembly -- but I think I have a fairly accurate notion of what the Negroes in the gallery were thinking .
I had intended to be there myself .
It was my first reaction upon hearing of Lumumba's death .
I was curious about the impact of this political assassination on Negroes in Harlem , for Lumumba had -- has -- captured the popular imagination there .
I was curious to know if Lumumba's death , which is surely among the most sinister of recent events , would elicit from `` our '' side anything more than the usual , well-meaning rhetoric .
And I was curious about the African reaction .
However , the chaos on my desk prevented my being in the U.N. gallery .
Had I been there , I , too , in the eyes of most Americans , would have been merely a pawn in the hands of the Communists .
The climate and the events of the last decade , and the steady pressure of the `` cold '' war , have given Americans yet another means of avoiding self-examination , and so it has been decided that the riots were `` Communist '' inspired .
Nor was it long , naturally , before prominent Negroes rushed forward to assure the republic that the U.N. rioters do not represent the real feeling of the Negro community .
According , then , to what I take to be the prevailing view , these rioters were merely a handful of irresponsible , Stalinist-corrupted provocateurs .
I find this view amazing .
It is a view which even a minimal effort at observation would immediately contradict .
One has only , for example , to walk through Harlem and ask oneself two questions .
The first question is : Would I like to live here ? ?
And the second question is : Why don't those who now live here move out ? ?
The answer to both questions is immediately obvious .
Unless one takes refuge in the theory -- however disguised -- that Negroes are , somehow , different from white people , I do not see how one can escape the conclusion that the Negro's status in this country is not only a cruel injustice but a grave national liability .
Now , I do not doubt that , among the people at the U.N. that day , there were Stalinist and professional revolutionists acting out of the most cynical motives .
Wherever there is great social discontent , these people are , sooner or later , to be found .
Their presence is not as frightening as the discontent which creates their opportunity .
What I find appalling -- and really dangerous -- is the American assumption that the Negro is so contented with his lot here that only the cynical agents of a foreign power can rouse him to protest .
It is a notion which contains a gratuitous insult , implying , as it does , that Negroes can make no move unless they are manipulated .
Color was delayed until 1935 , the wide screen until the early fifties .
Movement itself was the chief and often the only attraction of the primitive movies of the nineties .
Each film consisted of fifty feet , which gives a running time of about one minute on the screen .
As long as audiences came to see the movement , there seemed little reason to adventure further .
Motion-picture exhibitions took place in stores in a general atmosphere like that of the penny arcade which can still be found in such urban areas as Times Square .
Brief snips of actual events were shown : parades , dances , street scenes .
The sensational and frightening enjoyed popularity : a train rushes straight at the audience , or a great wave threatens to break over the seats .
An early Edison production was The Execution Of Mary , Queen Of Scots .
The unfortunate queen mounted the scaffold ; ;
the headsman swung his axe ; ;
the head dropped off ; ;
end of film .
An early film by a competitor of the Wizard of Menlo Park simply showed a long kiss performed by two actors of the contemporary stage .
In the field of entertainment there is no spur to financial daring so effective as audience boredom , and the first decade of the new device was not over before audiences began staying away in large numbers from the simple-minded , one-minute shows .
In response , the industry allowed the discovery of the motion picture as a form of fiction and thus gave the movies the essential form they have had to this day .
Despite the sheer beauty and spectacle of numerous documentaries , art films , and travelogues , despite the impressive financial success of such a recent development as Cinerama , the movies are at heart a form of fiction , like the play , the novel , or the short story .
Moreover , the most artistically successful of the nonfiction films have invariably borrowed the narrative form from the fiction feature .
Thus such great American documentaries as The River and The Plow That Broke The Plains were composed as visual stories rather than as illustrated lectures .
The discovery that movies are a form of fiction was made in the early years of this century and it was made chiefly by two men , a French magician , Georges Melies , and an American employee of Edison , Edwin S. Porter .
Of the two , Porter is justly the better known , for he went far beyond the vital finding of fiction for films to take the first step toward fashioning a language of film , toward making the motion picture the intricate , efficient time machine that it has remained since , even in the most inept hands .
Narrative time and film time
Melies , however , out of his professional instincts as a magician , discovered and made use of a number of illusionary techniques that remain part of the vocabulary of film .
One of these is the `` dissolve '' , which makes possible a visually smooth transition from scene to scene .
As the first scene begins to fade , the succeeding scene begins to appear .
For a moment or two , both scenes are present simultaneously , one growing weaker , one growing stronger .
In a series of fairy tales and fantasies , Melies demonstrated that the film is superbly equipped to tell a straightforward story , with beginning , middle and end , complications , resolutions , climaxes , and conclusions .
Immediately , the film improved and it improved because in narrative it found a content based on time to complement its own unbreakable connection with time .
Physically , a movie is possible because a series of images is projected one at a time at such a speed that the eye `` remembers '' the one that has gone before even as it registers the one now appearing .
Linking the smoothly changing images together , the eye itself endows them with the illusion of movement .
The `` projection '' time of painting and sculpture is highly subjective , varying from person to person and even varying for a given person on different occasions .
So is the time of the novel .
The drama in the theater and the concert in the hall both have a fixed time , but the time is fixed by the director and the players , the conductor and the instrumentalists , subject , therefore , to much variation , as record collectors well know .
The time of the motion picture is fixed absolutely .
The film consists of a series of still , transparent photographs , or `` frames '' , 35-mm.-wide .
Each frame comes between the light and the lens and is individually projected on the screen , at the rate , for silent movies , of 16 frames per second , and , for sound films , 24 frames per second .
This is the rate of projection ; ;
it is also the rate of photographing .
Time is built into the motion picture , which cannot exist without time .
Now time is also the concern of the fictional narrative , which is , at its simplest , the story of an action with , usually , a beginning , a middle , and an end -- elements which demand time as the first condition for their existence .
The `` moving '' picture of the train or the wave coming at the audience is , to be sure , more intense than a still picture of the same subject , but the difference is really one of degree ; ;
the cinematic element of time is merely used to increase the realism of an object which would still be reasonably realistic in a still photo .
In narrative , time is essential , as it is in film .
Almost everything about the movies that is peculiarly of the movies derives from a tension created and maintained between narrative time and film time .
This discovery of Melies was vastly more important than his sometimes dazzling , magician's tricks produced on film .
It was Porter , however , who produced the very first movie whose name has lived on through the half century of film history that has since ensued .
The movie was The Great Train Robbery and its effects on the young industry and art were all but incalculable .
Overnight , for one thing , Porter's film multiplied the standard running time of movies by ten .
The Great Train Robbery is a one-reel film .
One reel -- from eight to twelve minutes -- became the standard length from the year of Robbery , 1903 , until Griffith shattered that limit forever with Birth Of A Nation in 1915 .
The reel itself became and still is the standard of measure for the movies .
The material of the Porter film is simplicity itself ; ;
much of it has continued to be used over the years and the heart of it -- good guys and bad guys in the old West -- pretty well dominated television toward the end of the 1950's .
A band of robbers enters a railroad station , overpowers and ties up the telegraph operator , holds up the train and escapes .
A posse is formed and pursues the robbers , who , having made their escape , are whooping it up with some wild , wild women in a honky-tonk hide-out .
The robbers run from the hide-out , take cover in a wooded declivity , and are shot dead by the posse .
As a finale is appended a close-up of one of the band taking aim and firing his revolver straight at the audience .
All this is simple enough , but in telling the story Porter did two important things that had not been done before .
Each scene is shot straight through , as had been the universal custom , from a camera fixed in a single position , but in the outdoor scenes , especially in the capture and destruction of the outlaws , Porter's camera position breaks , necessarily , with the camera position standard until then , which had been , roughly , that of a spectator in a center orchestra seat at a play .
The plane of the action in the scene is not parallel with the plane of the film in the camera or on the screen .
If the change , at first sight , seems minor , we may recall that it took the Italian painters about two hundred years to make an analogous change , and the Italian painters , by universal consent , were the most brilliant group of geniuses any art has seen .
In that apparently simple shift Porter opened the way to the sensitive use of the camera as an instrument of art as well as a mechanical recording device .
He did more than that .
He revealed the potential value of the `` cut '' as the basic technique in the art of the film .
Cutting , of course , takes place automatically in the creation of a film .
The meaning of the word is quite physical , to begin with .
The physical film is cut with a knife at the end of one complete sequence , and the cut edge is joined physically , by cement , to the cut edge of the beginning of the next sequence .
If , as a home movie maker , you shoot the inevitable footage of your child taking its first steps , you have merely recorded an historical event .
If , in preparing that shot for the inevitable showing to your friends , you interrupt the sequence to paste in a few frames of the child's grandmother watching this event , you have begun to be an artist in film ; ;
you are employing the basic technique of film ; ;
you are cutting .
This is what Porter did .
As the robbers leave the looted train , the film suddenly cuts back to the station , where the telegrapher's little daughter arrives with her father's dinner pail only to find him bound on the floor .
She dashes around in alarm .
The two events are taking place at the same time .
Time and space have both become cinematic .
We leap from event to event -- including the formation of the posse -- even though the events , in `` reality '' are taking place not in sequence but simultaneously , and not near each other but at a considerable distance .
The `` chase '' as a standard film device probably dates from The Great Train Robbery , and there is a reason for the continued popularity of the device .
The chase in itself is a narrative ; ;
it presumes both speed and urgency and it demands cutting -- both from pursued to pursuer and from stage to stage of the journey of both .
The simple , naked idea of one man chasing another is of its nature better fitted for the film than it is for any other form of fiction .
The cowboy films , the cops and robbers films , and the slapstick comedy films culminating in an insane chase are not only catering to what critics may assume to be a vulgar taste for violence ; ;
these films and these sequences are also seeking out -- instinctively or by design -- the peculiarly cinematic elements of narrative .
The creator of the art of the film : D.W. Griffith
There still remained the need for one great film artist to explore the full potential of the new form and to make it an art .
The man was D.W. Griffith .
When he came to the movies -- more or less by accident -- they were still cheap entertainment capable of enthralling the unthinking for an idle few minutes .
In about seven years Griffith either invented or first realized the possibilities of virtually every resource at the disposal of the film maker .
Before he was forty Griffith had created the art of the film .
Not that there had not been attempts , mostly European , to do exactly that .
But in general the European efforts to make an art of the entertainment had ignored the slowly emerging language of the film itself .
Staggeringly condensed versions of famous novels and famous plays were presented .
Great actors and actresses -- the most notable being Sarah Bernhardt -- were hired to repeat their stage performances before the camera .
In all of this extensive and expensive effort , the camera was downgraded to the status of recording instrument for art work produced elsewhere by the actor or by the author .
The phonograph today , for all its high fidelity and stereophonic sound , is precisely what the early art purveyors in the movies wished to make of the camera .
Not surprisingly , this approach did not work .
The effort produced a valuable record of stage techniques in the early years of the century and some interesting records of great theater figures who would otherwise be only names .
But no art at all was born of the art effort in the early movies .
In general , religious interest seems to exist in all parts of the metropolis ; ;
congregational membership , however , is another thing .
A congregation survives only if it can sustain a socially homogeneous membership ; ;
that is , when it can preserve economic integration .
Religious faith can be considered a necessary condition of membership in a congregation , since the decision to join a worshiping group requires some motive force , but faith is not a sufficient condition for joining ; ;
the presence of other members of similar social and economic level is the sufficient condition .
The breakdown of social homogeneity in inner city areas and the spread of inner city blight account for the decline of central city churches .
Central cities reveal two adverse features for the major denominations : ( 1 ) central cities tend to be areas of residence for lower social classes ; ;
( 2 ) central cities tend to be more heterogeneous in social composition .
The central city areas , in other words , exhibit the two characteristics which violate the life principle of congregations of the major denominations : they have too few middle-class people ; ;
they mix middle-class people with lower-class residents .
Central city areas have become progressively poorer locales for the major denominations since the exodus of middle-class people from most central cities .
With few exceptions , the major denominations are rapidly losing their hold on the central city .
The key to Protestant development , therefore , is economic integration of the nucleus of the congregation .
Members of higher and lower social status often cluster around this nucleus , so that Protestant figures on social class give the impression of spread over all social classes ; ;
but this is deceptive , for the core of membership is concentrated in a single social and economic stratum .
The congregation perishes when it is no longer possible to replenish that core from the neighborhood ; ;
moreover , residential mobility is so high in metropolitan areas that churches have to recruit constantly in their core stratum in order to survive ; ;
they can lose higher- and lower-status members from the church without collapsing , but they need adequate recruits for the core stratum in order to preserve economic integration .
The congregation is first and foremost an economic peer group ; ;
it is secondarily a believing and worshiping fellowship .
If it were primarily a believing fellowship , it would recruit believers from all social and economic ranks , something which most congregations of the New Protestantism ( with a few notable exceptions ) have not been able to do .
They survive only when they can recruit social and economic peers .
The vulnerability of Protestant congregations to social differences has often been attributed to the `` folksy spirit '' of Protestant religious life ; ;
in fact , a contrast is often drawn in this regard with the `` impersonal '' Roman Catholic parish .
We have seen that the folksy spirit is confined to economic peers ; ;
consequently , the vulnerability to social difference should not be attributed to the stress on personal community in Protestant congregations ; ;
actually , there is little evidence of such personal community in Protestant congregations , as we shall see in another connection .
The vulnerability of Protestantism to social differences stems from the peculiar role of the new religious style in middle-class life , where the congregation is a vehicle of social and economic group identity and must conform , therefore , to the principle of economic integration .
This fact is evident in the recruitment of new members .
Mission as co-optation
The rule of economic integration in congregational life can be seen in the missionary outreach of the major denominations .
There is much talk in theological circles about the `` Church as Mission '' and the `` Church's Mission '' ; ;
theologians have been stressing the fact that the Church does not exist for its own sake but as a testimony in the world for the healing of the world .
A crucial question , therefore , is what evangelism and mission actually mean in metropolitan Protestantism .
If economic integration really shapes congregational life , then evangelism should be a process of extending economic integration .
The task of a congregation would be defined , according to economic integration , as the work of co-opting individuals and families of similar social and economic position to replenish the nuclear core of the congregation .
( Co-optation means to choose by joint action in order to fill a vacancy ; ;
it can also mean the assimilation of centers of power from an environment in order to strengthen an organization .
) In a mobile society , congregational health depends on a constant process of recruitment ; ;
this recruitment , however , must follow the pattern of economic integration or it will disrupt the congregation ; ;
therefore , the recruitment or missionary outreach of the congregation will be co-optation rather than proclamation -- like elements will have to be assimilated .
Evangelism and congregational outreach have not been carefully studied in the churches ; ;
one study in Pittsburgh , however , has illuminated the situation .
In a sample of new members of Pittsburgh churches , almost 60 per cent were recruited by initial `` contacts with friendly members '' .
If we add to these contacts with friendly members the `` contacts with an organization of the church '' ( 11.2 per cent of the cases ) , then a substantial two thirds of all recruitment is through friendly contact .
On the surface , this seems a sound approach to Christian mission : members of the congregation show by their friendly attitudes that they care for new people ; ;
the new people respond in kind by joining the church .
Missionary outreach by friendly contact looks somewhat different when one reflects on what is known about friendly contact in metropolitan neighborhoods ; ;
the majority of such contacts are with people of similar social and economic position ; ;
association by level of achievement is the dominant principle of informal relations .
This means that the antennae of the congregation are extended into the community , picking up the wave lengths of those who will fit into the social and economic level of the congregation ; ;
the mission of the church is actually a process of informal co-optation ; ;
the lay ministry is a means to recruit like-minded people who will strengthen the social class nucleus of the congregation .
Churches can be strengthened through this process of co-optation so long as the environs of the church provide a sufficient pool of people who can fit the pattern of economic integration ; ;
once the pool of recruits diminishes , the congregation is helpless -- friendly contacts no longer keep it going .
The transmutation of mission to co-optation is further indicated by the insignificance of educational activities , worship , preaching , and publicity in reaching new members .
The proclamation of the churches is almost totally confined to pastoral contacts by the clergy ( 17.3 per cent of new members ) and friendly contacts by members ( over two thirds if organizational activities are included ) .
Publicity accounted for 1.1 per cent of the initial contacts with new members .
In general , friendly contact with a member followed by contact with a clergyman will account for a major share of recruitment by the churches , making it quite evident that the extension of economic integration through co-optation is the principal form of mission in the contemporary church ; ;
economic integration and co-optation are the two methods by which Protestants associate with and recruit from the neighborhood .
The inner life of congregations will prosper so long as like-minded people of similar social and economic level can fraternize together ; ;
the outer life of congregations -- the suitability of the environment to their survival -- will be propitious so long as the people in the area are of the same social and economic level as the membership .
Economic integration ceases when the social and economic statuses in an area become too mixed or conflict with the status of the congregation .
In a rapidly changing society congregations will run into difficulties repeatedly , since such nice balances of economic integration are hard to sustain in the metropolis for more than a single generation .
The fact that metropolitan churches of the major denominations have moved approximately every generation for the last hundred years becomes somewhat more intelligible in the light of this struggle to maintain economic balance .
The expense of this type of organization in religious life , when one recalls the number of city churches which deteriorated beyond repair before being abandoned , raises fundamental questions about the principle of Protestant survival in a mobile society ; ;
nonetheless , the prevalence of economic integration in congregations illumines the nature of the Protestant development .
It was observed in the introductory chapter that metropolitan life had split into two trends -- expanding interdependence on an impersonal basis and growing exclusiveness in local communal groupings .
These trends seem to be working at cross-purposes in the metropolis .
Residential associations struggle to insulate themselves against intrusions .
The motifs of impersonal interdependence and insulation of residential communities have polarized ; ;
the schism between central city and suburb , Negro and White , blue collar and white collar can be viewed as symptomatic of this deeper polarization of trends in the metropolis .
It now becomes evident that the denominational church is intimately involved with the economy of middle-class culture , for it serves to crystallize the social class identity of middle-class residential groupings .
The accelerated pace of metropolitan changes has accentuated the drive to conformity in congregations of the major denominations .
This conformity represents a desperate attempt to stabilize a hopelessly unstable environment .
More than creatures of metropolitan forces , the churches have taken the lead in counteracting the interdependence of metropolitan life , crystallizing and perpetuating the stratification of peoples , giving form to the struggle for social homogeneity in a world of heterogeneous peoples .
Since American life is committed above all to productivity and a higher standard of economic life , the countervailing forces of residential and religious exclusiveness have fought a desperate , rearguard action against the expanding interdependence of the metropolis .
Consumer communities have suffered at the hands of the productive interests .
Negroes , Puerto Ricans , and rural newcomers are slowly making their way into the cities .
Soon they will fight their way into the lower middle-class suburbs , and the churches will experience the same decay and rebuilding cycle which has characterized their history for a century .
The identification of the basic unit of religious organization -- the parish or congregation -- with a residential area is self-defeating in a modern metropolis , for it simply means the closing of an iron trap on the outreach of the Christian fellowship and the transmutation of mission to co-optation .
Mission to the metropolis contradicts survival of the congregation in the residential community , because the middle classes are fighting metropolitan interdependence with residential exclusion .
This interpretation of the role of residence in the economy of middle-class culture could lead to various projections for the churches .
It could be argued that any fellowship which centers in residential neighborhoods is doomed to become an expression of the panic for stable identity among the middle classes .
It could be argued that only such neighborhoods can sustain religious activity , since worship presupposes some local stabilities .
Whatever projection one makes , the striking fact about congregational and parochial life is the extent to which it is a vehicle of the social identity of middle-class people .
Attention will be given in the next chapter to the style of association in the denominational churches ; ;
this style is characteristically an expression of the communal style of the middle classes .
The keynotes of this style are activism and emphasis on achievements in gaining self-esteem .
These values give direction to the life of the middle-class man or woman , dictating the methods of child rearing , determining the pattern of community participation , setting the style for the psychiatric treatment of middle-class illness , and informing the congregational life of the major denominations .
`` Fellowship by likeness '' and `` mission by friendly contact '' form the iron cage of denominational religion .
Its contents are another matter , for they reveal the kinds of interests pursued by the congregation .
What goes on in the cage will occupy our attention under the rubric of the organization church .
An understanding of the new role of residential association in an industrial society serves to illuminate the forces which have fashioned the iron cage of conformity which imprisons the churches in their suburban captivity .
The perplexing question still remains as to why the middle classes turn to the churches as a vehicle of social identity when their clubs and charities should fill the same need .
With capital largely squandered , there seemed to them no other course to pursue .
The directors sold directly to concessionaires , who had to make their profits above the high prices asked by the company .
These concessionaires traded where they wished and generally dealt with the Indians through engages , who might be habitants , voyageurs , or even soldiers .
The concessionaires also had to pay a tax of one-tenth on the goods they traded , and all pelts were to be taken to company stores and shipped to France in company ships .
The company disposed of the pelts , but with what profit , the records do not show .
In accord with its penurious policy , the company failed to furnish presents to hold the loyalty of the principal Indians .
The lavish use of presents had been effective in expanding the Indian trade of New France and Louisiana in the previous century , and the change in liberality aroused resentment in the minds of the red men .
Traders from the English colonies were far more generous , and Indian loyalty turned to them .
Protests from governors and intendants passed unheeded , and the parsimonious policy of the company probably let loose Indian insurrections that brought ruin to the company .
In 1721 the King sent three commissioners to Louisiana with full powers to do all that was necessary to protect the colony .
They ordered the raising of troops and obtained 75,000 livres with which to build forts .
They adopted a program by which Louisiana was divided into five districts .
In each of these there was to be a strong military post , and a trading depot to supply the smaller trading houses .
For southeastern Louisiana , Mobile was the principal post , and it was to furnish supplies for trade to the north and east , in the region threatened by British traders .
Mobile was to be the anchor of a chain of posts extending northward to the sources of the Tennessee River .
Fort Toulouse , on the Alabama River , had been erected in 1714 for trade with the Alabamas and Choctaws , but money was available for only one other new post , near the present Nashville , Tennessee , and this was soon abandoned .
West of the Mobile district was the lower Mississippi district , of which New Orleans was headquarters .
Dependent upon it were posts on the lower Mississippi and the region westward to the frontiers of New Spain .
On the middle Mississippi a principal post was to be located near the mouth of the Arkansas .
It was hoped that to this post would flow a large quantity of furs from the west , principally down the Arkansas River .
On the Ohio or Wabash was to be built another post `` at the fork of two great rivers '' .
Other posts would be established up the Ohio and Wabash to protect communication with Canada .
On the upper Mississippi the Illinois post was to be established near Kaskaskia , and dependent posts were to be built on the Missouri , `` where there are mines in abundance '' .
Each of the five principal posts was to have a director , responsible to a director-general at New Orleans .
An elaborate system of accounting and reports was worked out , and the trade was to be managed in the most scientific way .
Concessionaires were to be under the supervision of the directors .
Engages must be loyal to the concessionaires , and must serve until the term provided in the engagement was ended .
The habitants were to be encouraged to trade and were to dispose of their pelts to the concessionaires .
Only two principal storehouses were actually established -- one at Mobile , the other at New Orleans .
New Orleans supplied the goods for the trade on the Mississippi , and west of that river , and on the Ohio and Wabash .
Mobile was also supplied by New Orleans with goods for the Mobile district .
The power that Bienville exercised during his first administration cannot be determined .
Regulations for the Indian trade were made by the Conseil superieure de la Louisiane , and Bienville apparently did not have control of that body .
The Conseil even treated the serious matter of British aggression as its business and , on its own authority , sent to disaffected savages merchandise `` suitable for the peltry trade '' .
It decided , also , that the purely secular efforts of Bienville were insufficient , and sent missionaries to win the savages from the heathen Carolinians .
During the first administration of Bienville , the peltry trade of the Mobile district was a lucrative source of revenue .
The Alabamas brought in annually 15,000 to 20,000 deerskins , and the Choctaws and Chickasaws brought the total up to 50,000 pelts .
These deerskins were the raw material for the manufacture of leather , and were the only articles which the tribes of this district had to exchange for European goods .
During his first administration , Bienville succeeded in keeping Carolina traders out of the Alabama country and the Choctaw country .
The director of the post at Mobile kept an adequate amount of French goods , of a kind to which they were accustomed , to supply the Indian needs .
The Alabama and Tombigbee rivers furnished a highway by which goods could be moved quickly and cheaply .
De La Laude , commander of the Alabama post , had the friendship of the natives , and was able to make them look upon the British as poor competitors .
Diron D'Artaguette , the most prominent trader in the district , was energetic and resourceful , but his methods often aroused the ire of the French governors .
He became , after a time , commander of a post on the Alabama River , but his operations extended from Mobile throughout the district , and he finally obtained a monopoly of the Indian trade .
The Chickasaws were the principal source of trouble in the Mobile district .
Their territory lay to the north , near the sources of the Alabama , the Tombigbee , the Tennessee , and Cumberland rivers , and was easily accessible to traders among the near-by Cherokees .
In 1720 some Chickasaws massacred the French traders among them , and did not make peace for four years .
Venturesome traders , however , continued to come to them from Mobile , and to obtain a considerable number of pelts for the French markets .
British traders from South Carolina incited the Indians against the French , and there developed French and British Factions in the tribe .
The Chickasaws finally were the occasion for the most disastrous wars during the French control of Louisiana .
To hold them was an essential part of French policy , for they controlled the upper termini of the routes from the north to Mobile .
They threatened constantly to give the British a hold on this region , from whence they could move easily down the rivers to the French settlements near the Gulf .
Bienville realized that if the French were to hold the southeastern tribes against the enticements of British goods , French traders must be able to offer a supply as abundant as the Carolinians and at reasonable prices .
His urgings brought some results .
The Company of the Indies promised to send over a supply of Indian trading goods , and to price them more cheaply in terms of deerskins .
But it coupled with this a requirement that Indians must bring their pelts to Mobile and thus save all costs of transportation into and out of the Indian country .
The insistence of Bienville upon giving liberal prices to the Indians , in order to drive back the Carolina traders , was probably a factor that led to his recall in 1724 .
For two years his friend and cousin , Boisbriant , remained as acting governor and could do little to stem the Anglican advance .
Although he incited a few friendly Indians to pillage the invaders , and even kill some of them , the Carolina advance continued .
The company was impressed with some ideas of the danger from Carolina , and when Perier came over as governor in 1727 , he was given special instructions regarding the trade of the Mobile district .
But the Company of the Indies , holding to its program of economy , made no arrangements to furnish better goods at attractive prices .
To the directors the problem appeared a matter of intrigue or diplomacy .
Perier attempted to understand the problem by sending agents to inquire among the Indians .
These agents were to ascertain the difference between English and French goods , and the prices charged the Indians .
They were to conciliate the unfriendly savages , and , wherever possible , to incite the natives to pillage the traders from Carolina .
They were to promise fine presents to the loyal red men , as well as an abundant supply of trading goods at better prices than the opposition was offering .
Perier's intrigues gained some successes .
The savages divided into two factions ; ;
one was British and the other , French .
So hostile did these factions become that , among the Choctaws , civil war broke out .
Perier's efforts , however , were on the whole ineffective in winning back the tribes of the Mobile district , and he decided to send troops into the troubled country .
He asked the government for two hundred soldiers , who were to be specifically assigned to arrest English traders and disloyal Indians .
In spite of the company's restrictions , he planned to build new posts in the territory .
He asked also for more supplies to trade at a low price for the Indians' pelts .
No help came from the crown , and Perier , in desperation , gave a monopoly of the Indian trade in the district to D'Artaguette .
D'Artaguette went vigorously to work , and gave credit to many hunters .
But they brought back few pelts to pay their debts , and soon French trade in the region was at an end .
Perier finally , in one last bid in 1730 , cut the price of goods to an advance of 40 per cent above the cost in France .
The Indians were not impressed and held to the Carolina traders , who swarmed over the country , almost to the Mississippi .
With the loss of the Mobile trade , which ended all profits from Louisiana , the Natchez Indians revolted .
They destroyed a trading house and pillaged the goods , and harassed French shipping on the Mississippi .
The war to subdue them taxed the resources of the colony and piled up enormous debts .
In January , 1731 , the company asked the crown to relieve it of the government of the colony .
It stated that it had lost 20,000,000 livres in its operations , and apparently blamed its poor success largely on the Indian trade .
It offered to surrender its right to exclusive trade , but asked an indemnity .
The King accepted the surrender and fixed the compensation of the company at 1,450,000 livres .
Thenceforth , the commerce of Louisiana was free to all Frenchmen .
Company rule in Louisiana left the colony without fortifications , arms , munitions , or supplies .
The difficulties of trade had ruined many voyageurs , and numbers of them had gone to live with the natives and rear half-blood families .
Others left the country , and there was no one familiar with the Indian trade .
If this trade should be resumed , the habitants who had come to be farmers or artisans , and soldiers discharged from the army , must be hardened to the severe life of coureurs de bois .
This was a slow and difficult course , and French trade suffered from the many mistakes of the new group of traders .
These men were without capital or experience .
Perier and Salmon , the intendant , wished either to entrust the trade to an association of merchants or to have the crown furnish goods on credit to individuals who would repay their debts with pelts .
Bienville , who returned to succeed Perier in 1732 , objected that the merchants would not accept the responsibility of managing a trade in which they could see no hope of profits .
He reported , too , that among the habitants there were none of probity and ability sufficient to justify entrusting them with the King's goods .
He did find some to trust , however , and he employed the King's soldiers to trade .
With no company to interfere , he kept close control over all the traders .
In order to compete with English traders , Bienville radically changed the price schedule .
The King should expect no profit , and an advance of only 20 per cent above the cost in France , which would cover the expense of transportation and handling , was all he charged the traders .
They would not be pleased to have it published back home that they planned a frolic in Paris or Hong Kong at the Treasury's expense .
They would be particularly displeased with the State Department if it were the source of such reports .
Few things are more perilous for the State Department than a displeased congressman .
The reason for this bears explaining for those who may wonder why State spends so much of its diplomatic energy on Congress when the Russians are so available .
First , the State Department is unique among government agencies for its lack of public supporters .
The farmers may be aroused if Congress cuts into the Agriculture Department's budget .
Businessmen will rise if Congress attacks the Commerce Department .
Labor restrains undue brutality toward the Labor Department ; ;
the Chamber of Commerce , assaults upon the Treasury .
A kaleidoscope of pressure groups make it unpleasant for the congressman who becomes ugly toward the Department of Health , Education , and Welfare .
The congressman's patriotism is always involved when he turns upon the Defense Department .
Tampering with the Post Office may infuriate every voter who can write .
With all these agencies , the congressman must constantly check the political wind and trim his sails accordingly .
No such political restraint subdues his blood when he gazes upon the State Department in anger .
In many sections he may even reap applause from press and public for giving it a good lesson .
After all , the money dispensed by State goes not to the farmer , the laborer , or the businessman , but to foreigners .
Not only do these foreigners not vote for American congressmen ; ;
they are also probably ungrateful for Uncle's Sam's bounty .
And are not the State Department men who dispense this largesse merely crackpots and do-gooders who have never met a payroll ? ?
Will not the righteous congressman be cheered at the polls if he reminds them to get right with America and if he saves the taxpayer some money by spoiling a few of their schemes ? ?
The chances are excellent that he will .
The result is that the State Department's perpetual position before Congress is the resigned pose of the whipping boy who expects to be kicked whenever the master has had a dyspeptic outing with his wife .
People in this position do not offend the master by relating his peccadilloes to the newspapers .
State keeps the junketeering list a secret .
The Department expects and receives no thanks from Congress for its discretion .
Congress is a harsh master .
State is expected to arrange the touring Cicero's foreign itinerary ; ;
its embassies are expected to supply him with reams of local money to pay his way ; ;
embassy workers are expected to entertain him according to his whim , frequently with their savings for the children's college tuition .
But come the next session of Congress , State can expect only that its summer guest will bite its hand when it goes to the Capitol asking money for diplomatic entertaining expenses abroad or for living expenses for its diplomats .
The congressman who , in Paris , may have stuffed his wallet with enough franc notes to paper the roof of Notre-Dame will systematically scream that a $200 increase in entertainment allowance for a second secretary is tantamount to debauchery of the Treasury .
In the matter of money State's most unrelenting watchdog during the Eisenhower years was Representative John J. Rooney , of Brooklyn , who controlled the purse for diplomatic administrative expenses .
Diplomats stayed up nights thinking of ways to attain peaceful coexistence , not with Nikita Khrushchev , but with John Rooney .
Nothing worked .
In the most confidential whispers ambassadors told of techniques they had tried to bring Rooney around -- friendly persuasion , groveling abasement , pressure subtly exerted through other powerful congressmen , tales of heartbreak and penury among a threadbare diplomatic corps .
Rooney remained untouched .
`` The trouble , '' explained Loy Henderson , then Deputy Undersecretary for Administration , `` is that when we get into an argument with him about this thing , it always turns out that Rooney knows more about our budget than we do '' .
One year the Department collected a file of case histories to document its argument that men in the field were paying the government's entertainment bills out of personal income .
News of the project reached the press .
Next day , reports went through the Department that Rooney had been outraged by what he considered a patent attempt to put public pressure on him for increased entertainment allowances and had sworn an oath that , that year , expense allowances would not rise a dollar .
They didn't .
The Department's constant fight with the House for money is a polite minuet compared with its periodic bloody engagements with the Senate .
Armed with constitutional power to negate the Executive's foreign policy , the Senate carries a big stick and is easily provoked to use it on the State Department's back , or on the head of the Secretary of State .
With its power to investigate , the Senate can paralyze the Secretary by keeping him in a state of perpetual testimony before committees , as it did with Dean Acheson .
John Foster Dulles escaped by keeping his personal show on the road and because Lyndon Johnson , who was then operating the Senate , refused to let it become an Inquisition .
During Dulles's first two years in office , while Republicans ran the Senate , the Department was at the mercy of men who had thirsted for its blood since 1945 .
An internal police operation managed by Scott McLeod , a former F.B.I. man installed as security officer upon congressional insistence , was part of the vengeance .
So was the attack upon Charles E. Bohlen when Eisenhower appointed him Ambassador to Moscow .
The principal mauler , however , was Senator Joseph McCarthy .
Where Acheson had fought a gallant losing battle for the Department , Dulles fed the crocodile with his subordinates .
Fretting privately but eschewing public defense of his terrorized bureaucrats , Dulles remained serene and detached while the hatchet men had their way .
In view of Eisenhower's reluctance to concede that anything was amiss in the Terror , it is doubtful that heroic intervention by Dulles could have produced anything but disaster for him and the country's foreign policy .
In any event , the example of Acheson's trampling by the Senate did not encourage Dulles to provoke it .
He elected to `` get along '' .
During this dark chapter in State Department history , men who had offered foreign-policy ideas later proven wrong by events filled the tumbrels sent up to Capitol Hill .
Their old errors of judgment were equated , in the curious logic of the time , with present treasonous intent .
Their successors , absorbing the lesson , made it a point to have few ideas .
This , in turn , brought a new fashion in senatorial criticism as the Democrats took control .
In the new style , the Department was berated as intellectually barren and unable to produce the vital ideas needed to outwit the Russians .
For three or four years in the mid-1950's , this complaint was heard rumbling up from the Senate floor whenever there was a dull legislative afternoon .
It became smart to say that the fault was with Dulles because he would not countenance thinking done by anyone but himself .
An equally tenable thesis is that the dearth of new thought was created by the Senate's own penchant for crucifying anyone whose ideas seem unorthodox to the next generation .
Getting along with foreigners
there are ninety-eight foreign embassies and legations in Washington .
They range from the Soviet Embassy on Sixteenth Street , a gray shuttered pile suggesting a funeral-accessories display house , to what Congressman Rooney has called `` that monstrosity on Thirty-fourth Street '' , the modern cement-and-glass chancery of the Belgians .
Here is the world of the chauffeured limousine and the gossip reporter , of caviar on stale crackers and the warm martini , of the poseur , the spy , the party crasher , and the patriot , of the rented tails , the double cross , and the tired Lothario .
Into its chanceries each day pour reports from ministries around the earth and an endless stream of home-office instructions on how to handle Uncle Sam in an infinite variety of contingencies .
Here are hatched plans for getting a share of the American bounty , the secret of the anti-missile missile , or an invitation to dinner .
Out of it each week go hundreds of thousands of words purporting to inform home ministries about what is really happening inside Washington .
Some , like the British and the French , maintain an elaborate system of personal contacts and have experts constantly studying special areas of the American scene .
Other embassies cable home The New York Times without changing a comma .
Each has its peculiar style .
The Soviet Embassy is popularly regarded as Russian espionage headquarters .
When Ambassador Mikhail Menshikov took it over in 1957 from Georgi Zaroubin , he made a determined effort to change this idea .
Menshikov hit Washington with a TV announcer's grin and a hearty handclasp .
To everyone's astonishment he seemed no more like the run-of-the-mine Russian ambassador than George Babbitt was like Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov .
Where his predecessors had glowered , Menshikov smiled .
Where they had affected the bleak social style of embalmers' assistants , Menshikov went abroad gorgeous in white tie and tails .
Overnight he became the most available man in Washington .
Speeches by the Soviet ambassador became the vogue as he obliged rural Maryland Rotarians and National Press Club alike .
In Senator Joseph McCarthy's phrase , it was the most unheard-of thing ever heard of .
A newspaperman who met him at a reception swore that he asked Menshikov : `` What should we call you '' ? ?
And that Menshikov replied : `` Just call me Mike '' .
`` Smilin' Mike '' was the sobriquet Washington gave him .
His English was usable and he used it fearlessly .
Toasting in champagne one night at the embassy , he hoisted his glass to a senator's wife and gaily cried : `` Up your bottom '' ! !
For a few giddy months that coincided with one of Moscow's smiling moods , he was the sensation of Washington .
At the State Department , hard-bitten Russian experts complained that the Capitol was out of its wits .
Newspaper punditry was inspired to remind everyone that Judas , too , had been able to smile .
The Menshikov interlude ended as larks with the Russians usually end .
Finding peaceful coexistence temporarily unsuitable because of domestic politics , Moscow resumed scowling and `` Smilin' Mike '' dropped quietly out of the press except for an occasional story reporting that he had been stoned somewhere in the Middle West .
The most inscrutable embassies are the Arabs' , and the most inscrutable of the Arabs are the Saudi Arabians .
When King Saud visited Washington , the overwhelming question consuming the press was the size of his family .
Rumor had it that his children numbered in the hundreds .
The State Department was little help on this , or on much else about Saudi Arabia .
A reporter who consulted a Middle East Information officer for routine vital statistics got nowhere until the State Department man produced from his bottom desk drawer a brochure published by the Arabian-American Oil Company .
`` This is where I get my information from '' , he confided .
`` But bring it right back .
It's the only copy I've got '' .
The size of Saud's family was still being debated when the King appeared for his first meeting with Eisenhower .
When it ended , a dusky sheik in desert robes flowed into Hagerty's office to report on the interview .
The massed reporters brushed aside the customary bromides about Saudi-American friendship to bore in on the central question .
How many children did the King have ? ?
`` Twenty-one '' , replied the sheik .
And how many of these were sons ? ?
`` Twenty-five '' , the sheik replied .
`` Do you mean to tell us '' , a reporter asked , `` that the King has twenty-one children , twenty-five of whom are sons '' ? ?
The sheik smiled and murmured : `` That is precisely correct '' .
The Egyptians are noted for elusiveness of language .
When Dag Hammarskjold was negotiating the Middle East peace after Israel's 1956 invasion of Egypt , he soon found himself speaking the mysterious phrases of Cairo , a language as anarchic as Casey Stengel's .
The reports of President Nasser's pledges which Hammarskjold was relaying from Cairo to Washington became increasingly incomprehensible to other diplomats , including the Israeli Foreign Minister , Mrs. Golda Meir .
Finally he reported that Nasser was ready to make a concrete commitment in return for Israeli concessions .
The deep water is used by many people , but it is always clean , for the washing is done outside .
I know now why our Japanese friends were surprised when they walked into our bathroom .
Of course , most toilets are Eastern style -- at floor level -- but even when they are raised to chair height , they are actually outside toilets -- inside .
A few newer homes have Western flush toilets , but even with running water , they are usually Eastern style .
The next day I visited International Christian College which has developed since the war under the leadership of people who were interned and who know Japan well .
They are trying to demonstrate some different ways of teaching and learning .
The library has open shelves even in the unbound periodical stockroom .
Spiritual life is cultivated , but students do not need to be Christian .
They have an enviable record of being able to place in employment 100% of their graduates .
In the afternoon Miss Hosaka and her mother invited me to go with them and young Mrs. Kodama to see the famous Spring dances of the Geisha dancers .
Mrs. Hosaka is one of the Japanese women one reads about -- beautiful , artistically talented , an artful manager of her big household -- ( four boys and four girls ) , and yet looking like a pampered , gentle Japanese woman .
She was a real experience ! !
The dances were as beautiful as anything I have ever seen -- they rival the New York Rockettes for scenery and precision as well as imagination .
Because Don was leaving the next day , I spent the evening with him at Asia Center .
The following morning Mr. Morikawa called for me , and we went to visit schools -- kindergarten , middle-school , elementary school , and high school -- Mr. Yoshimoto's school .
There is much more freedom in the schools here than I expected -- some think too much .
There is a great deal of thought being given to the question of moral education in the schools .
With the loss of the Emperor diety in Japan , the people are left in confusion with no God or moral teachings that have strength .
The older parents continued to teach their children traditional principles , but the younger people , who have lost all faith and convictions , are now parents .
There seems to be no purpose in life that is sure -- no certain guiding principles to give stability .
As a result , money is spent quickly and freely , with no thought of its value .
Gambling is everywhere , especially among students .
Parents indulge their children .
The government has recognized the dilemma and is beginning to devise some moral education for the schools -- but the teachers often have no firm conviction and are confused .
I was told that it is quite likely that Japanese soldiers would not fight again -- for why should they ? ?
It will be painful , but interesting , to see what kind of a god these people will create or what strong convictions they will develop .
In the evening the former Oregon State science teachers met for dinner at the New Tokyo Restaurant where I had my first raw fish and found it good .
They suggested several new foods , and usually I found them good , except the sweets , which I think I could learn to like .
Six of the science teachers were present , and we had great fun .
Kyoto
After a day at Nikko , Mrs. Kodama put me on the train for Kyoto .
My instructions were that Mr. Nishimo would meet me at the hotel , but instead he and three others were at the station with a very warm welcome .
My hotel rooms on the trip were arranged by Masu and the Japan Travel Bureau and were more elegant than I would have chosen , but it was fun for once to be elegant -- I did explain to the students , however , that this was not my usual style , for their salaries are very small , and it seemed out of place for me to be housed so well .
They understood and teased me a bit about it .
I think I would have been much disappointed in Japan if I had not seen Kyoto , Nara , and Hiroshima .
Kyoto is the ancient capital of Japan and still its cultural center .
It , along with Nara , was untouched by the war -- and is now a beautiful example of the loveliness of prewar Japan .
Here I was accompanied by Mrs. Okamoto ( Fumio's mother ) , her son , Mr. Washizu ( a prospective student with whom I have been corresponding for more than a year ) , and Mr. Nishima , one of the science teachers .
I arrived at 7:00 a.m. and by 9:00 a.m. I had finished breakfast and was on my way to see what they had planned .
We walked miles and saw various shrines and gardens .
We visited the Okamoto home -- where for the first time I saw the famous tea ceremony .
At 6:00 p.m. we went to the Kyoto Spring dances at the place where these beautiful dances originated .
They were even better than those of Tokyo -- more spectacular and more imaginative .
After a supper of unagi ( rice with eel -- eel which is raised in an ice-cold pond at the foot of Mt. Fuji ) , I returned to my beautiful room to sleep as hard as possible to be ready for another busy day .
We started at 9 a.m. to visit the Kyoto University where Mr. Washizu is attending .
I was amazed at the very poor hospital facilities accompanying the medical school .
They apologized for the condition , including dirt and flies , and I was a little at a loss to know what to say .
There seemed to be no excuse ? ?
I don't have the answer yet .
We had tea at Mr. Washizu's home where I learned that he , too , comes from a very wealthy family .
His grandfather is a Buddhist priest ; ;
and he , being the eldest , was supposed to be a priest , but he chose to do differently , and one of his brothers is to become the priest .
This is a significant fact in Japan , for only a few years ago he would have had no choice .
In his big home live four families and thirty people , so it needs to be big .
Also , there are housed here some priceless historical treasures from 400 to 600 years old -- paintings , lacquer , brocade , etc. .
He had displayed more of them than usual so that I could enjoy them .
About 100 of the most important items he had already given to the museum .
The house itself is 400 years old with all the craftsmanship of older , less-hurried times .
Nara , Osaka , and Hiroshima
Mr. Nishima went with me on the train to Nara .
We passed his house and school on the way .
In Nara I stayed at the hotel where the Prince and Princess had stayed on their honeymoon .
A new red carpet had been laid for their coming , but I walked on it , too .
Here Mr. Yoneda met us after a three-hour train trip from the town where he teaches .
Even though we had walked miles in Kyoto that day , we started out again to see Nara at night .
