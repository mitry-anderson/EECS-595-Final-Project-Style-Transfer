Exponents of Zen often insist that very early Zen doctrine opposed the rampant supernaturalism of China , and proposed instead a more mature , less credulous view of the universe .In support of this , stories from the early literature are cited to show that Zen attacks the idea of supernatural power .But actually these accounts reveal the supernatural powers that the masters were in fact supposed to possess , as well as the extreme degree of popular credulity : `` Hwang Pah ( O Baku ) , one day going up Mount Tien Tai which was believed to have been inhabited by Arhats with supernatural powers , met with a monk whose eyes emitted strange light .They went along the pass talking with each other for a short while until they came to a river roaring with torrent .There being no bridge , the master had to stop at the shore ; ;
but his companion crossed the river walking on the water and beckoned to Hwang Pah to follow him .Thereupon Hwang Pah said : `` If I knew thou art an Arhat , I would have doubled you up before thou got over there '' ! !The monk then understood the spiritual attainment of Hwang Pah , and praised him as a true Mahayanist .( 1 ) ''A second tale shows still more clearly the kind of powers a truly spiritual monk could possess : `` On one occasion Yang Shan ( Kyo-zan ) saw a stranger monk flying through the air .
When that monk came down and approached him with a respectful salutation , he asked : `` Where art thou from '' ? ?`` Early this morning '' , replied the other , `` I set out from India '' .`` Why '' , said the teacher , `` art thou so late '' ? ?`` I stopped '' , responded the man , `` several times to look at beautiful sceneries '' .`` Thou mayst have supernatural powers '' , exclaimed Yang Shan , `` yet thou must give back the Spirit of Buddha to me '' .
Then the monk praised Yang Shan saying : `` I have come over to China in order to worship Manjucri , and met unexpectedly with Minor Shakya '' , and after giving the master some palm leaves he brought from India , went back through the air .( 2 ) ''In the popular Chinese mind , Ch'an ( Zen ) was no exception to the ideas of coarse magic that dominated .A closer look at modern Zen reveals many magical carryovers that are still part of popular Zen attitudes .To the Zen monk the universe is still populated with `` spiritual beings '' who have to be appeased .
Part of the mealtime ritual in the Zendo consists in offerings of rice to the spiritual beings '' .Modern Zen presentation to the West insists on the anti-authoritarian , highly pragmatic nature of the Zen belief -- scriptures are burned to make fire , action is based on direct self-confidence , and so on .This picture of extreme self-reliant individuation is difficult to reconcile with such Zendo formulas as : `` O you , demons and other spiritual beings , I now offer this to you , and may this food fill up the ten quarters of the world and all the demons and other spiritual beings be fed therewith .( 3 )Pope Leo 13 , on the 13th day of December 1898 , granted the following indulgences : `` An indulgence of three hundred days is granted to all the Faithful who read the Holy Gospels at least a quarter of an hour .
A Plenary Indulgence under the usual conditions is granted once a month for the daily reading '' .Pope Pius the Sixth , at Rome , in April , 1778 , wrote the following : `` The faithful should be excited to the reading of the Holy Scriptures : For these are the most abundant sources which ought to be left open to everyone , to draw from them purity of morals and of doctrine , to eradicate errors which are so widely disseminated in these corrupt times '' .The American Bishops assembled at the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore urged the Catholic people to read the Holy Bible .`` We hope '' , they said , `` that no family can be found amongst us without a correct version of the Holy Scriptures '' .They recommended , also , that `` at a fixed hour , let the entire family be assembled for night prayers , followed by a short reading of the Holy Scriptures '' .
Since the Catholic Church expresses such desire that the Sacred Scriptures be read , the following taken from the Holy Bible ( New Catholic Edition ) will prove a means of grace and a source of great spiritual blessing .The need of the new birthDo not wonder that I said to thee , `` You must be born again '' .St. John 3 : 7 .The new birth is necessary because god is holy .
But as the One who called you is holy , be you also holy in all your behavior ; ;for it is written , You shall be holy , because I am holy .1 , St. Peter 15 , 16 .Holiness without which no man will see God .Hebrews 14 .
The new birth is necessary because all have sinned .As it is written , There is not one just man ; ;there is none who understands ; ;there is none who seeks after God .All have gone astray together ; ;
All have sinned and have need of the glory of God .Romans 3 : 10-12 , 23 .The new birth is necessary because the natural man is spiritually dead and blind .Therefore as through one man sin entered into the world and through sin death , and thus death has passed unto all men because all have sinned .Romans 12 .
You also , when you were dead by reason of your offenses and sins .Ephesians 2 : 1 .And if our gospel also is veiled , it is veiled only to those who are perishing .In their case , the god of this world ( Satan ) has blinded their unbelieving minds , that they should not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ , who is the image of God .2 , Corinthians 4 : 3 , 4 .
For his workmanship we are , created in Christ Jesus .Ephesians 10 .The new birth is effected through the word of God.For you have been reborn , not from corruptible seed but from incorruptible , through the word of God .
1 St. Peter 23 .Of his own will he has begotten us by the word of truth .St. James 18 .Amen , amen , I say to thee , unless a man be born again of water ( symbol of the Word of God , see Ephesians 26 ) and the Spirit , he cannot enter into the kingdom of God .That which is born of the flesh is flesh ; ;
and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit .St. John 3 : 5 , 6 .Evidences of the new birthif we are born of god we have faith in Christ as the only saviour .Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God .
1 St. John 5 : 1 .As many as received him were born of God .St. John 12 , 13 .If we are born of God we do not practice sin as a habit .Whoever is born of God does not commit sin ( That is , he does not practice sin .
Cf. 1 St. John 2 : 1 ) .1 St. John 3 : 9 .We know that no one who is born of God commits sin .1 St. John 18 .( The new nature , received at the time of regeneration , is divine and holy , and as the believer lives under the power of this new nature he does not practice sin .
) if we are born of god we practice righteousness .If you know that he ( God ) is just ( righteous ) , know that everyone also who does what is just ( righteous ) has been born of him .1 St. John 29 .If we are born of God we love God .Everyone who loves is born of God , and knows God .
1 St. John 4 : 7 .If we are born of God we love the brethren .We know that we have passed from death to life , because we love the brethren .He who does not love abides in death .1 St. John 14 .
If we are born of God we overcome the world .All that is born of God overcomes the world ; ;and this is the victory that overcomes the world , our faith .1 St. John 5 : 4 .If we are born of God we grow in ( not into , but in ) grace .
But grow in grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior , Jesus Christ .2 St. Peter 18 .If we are born of God we persevere unto the end .I am convinced of this , that he who has begun a good work in you will bring it to perfection until the day of Christ Jesus .Philippians 1 : 6 .
Now to him who is able to preserve you without sin and to set you before the presence of his glory , without blemish , in gladness , to the only God our Savior , through Jesus Christ our Lord , belong glory and majesty , dominion and authority , before all time , and now , and forever .St. Jude 24 .The new birth is necessary because the spiritual kingdom requires a spiritual nature .Jesus answered and said to him ( Nicodemus ) `` Amen , amen , I say to thee , unless a man be born again , he cannot see the kingdom of God '' .`` Amen , amen , I say to thee , unless a man be born again of water and the Spirit , he cannot enter into the kingdom of God .
That which is born of the flesh is flesh ; ;and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit .Do not wonder that I said to thee , ' You must be born again ' '' .St. John 3 : 3 , 5-7 .The nature of the new birth
the new birth is a new creation .For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision but a new creation is of any account .Galatians 15 .If then any man is in Christ , he is a new creature ( literally , `` He is a new creation ) , the former things have passed away ; ;behold , they are made new ! !
2 Corinthians 17 .For by grace you have been saved through faith ; ;and that not from yourselves , for it is the gift of God ; ;not as the outcome of works , lest anyone may boast .For his workmanship we are , created in Christ Jesus .
Ephesians 2 : 8-10 .The new birth is the implantation of a new life .I came that they may have life .St. John 10 .He who has the Son has the life .
He who has not the Son has not the life .1 St. John 12 .He who believes in the Son ( Jesus Christ , the Son of God ) , has everlasting life .St. John 36 .The new birth is the impartation of the divine nature .
Through which he has granted us the very great and precious promises , so that through them you may become partaker of the divine nature .2 St. Peter 1 : 4 .The new birth is Christ living in you by faith .Christ in you , your hope of glory .Colossians 27 .
It is now no longer I that live , but Christ lives in me .And the life that I now live in the flesh , I live in the faith of the Son of God , who loved me and gave himself up for me .Galatians 20 .To have Christ dwelling through faith in your hearts .Ephesians 17 .
The new birth is miraculous and mysterious .The wind blows where it will , and thou hearest its sound but dost not know where it comes from or where it goes .So is everyone who is born of the Spirit .St. John 3 : 8 .The new birth is immediate and instantaneous .
Amen , amen , I say to you , he who hears my word , and believes him who sent me , has life everlasting , and does not come to judgment , but has passed from death to life .St. John 24 .The means of the new birththe new birth is a work of god .But to as many as received him he gave the power of becoming sons of God ; ;
to those who believe in his name : Who were born not of blood , nor of the will of the flesh , nor of the will of man , but of God .St. John 12 , 13 .A final wordYou may be very religious , a good church member , an upright , honest and sincere person ; ;you may be baptized , confirmed , reverent and worshipful ; ;
you may attend mass , do penance , say prayers and zealously keep all the sacraments and ceremonies of the church ; ;you may have the final and extreme unction but if you are not born again you are lost and headed for hell and eternal punishment .You cannot be saved ; ;you cannot go to heaven unless you are born again .Our blessed Lord Jesus Christ , the sinless Son of God , who could not lie , said , `` Amen , amen , I say to thee , unless a man be born again , he cannot see the kingdom of God '' ( St. John 3 : 3 ) .
`` You must be born again '' ( St. John 3 : 7 ) .Being convinced that salvation is alone by accepting Christ as Saviour , and being convicted by the Holy Spirit of my lost condition , I do repent of all effort to be saved by any form of good works , and just now receive Jesus as my personal Saviour and salvation as a free gift from Him .You may do as you please with God now .It is permitted .God placed Himself in men's hands when He sent Jesus Christ into the world as perfect God and perfect Man in one Being .
He was then in man's hands .They cursed Him .It was permitted .Men spit on Him .God allowed it .
They called Him a devil .God withheld His wrath .Finally men arrested Him , gave Him a mock trial , flogged Him , nailed Him on a cross and hung Him between earth and heaven ; ;and God allowed it .You can do likewise though Christ is not bodily present .
You can ignore Him .You can ignore His Book , the Bible , and His church .You can laugh at His blood-bought salvation , curse His followers , and laugh at hell .It is permitted .The eternal Christ may knock at your soul's door , calling you to give up sin and prepare for heaven .
You may refuse Him , spit on Him , call Him a devil , curse Him .It is permitted .You may take His name upon your lips in oaths and curses if you so choose .He is in your hands -- now .On the other hand , you may seek His favor , humble yourself before Him and beg His mercy , implore His forgiveness , forsake your sins , and abandon your whole life to Him .
He has said , `` Behold , I stand at the door , and knock : if any man hear my voice , and open the door , I will come in to him , and will sup with him , and he with me '' ( Revelation 3:20 : :20 ) .The choice is up to you .The latch is on your side of the door .The choice is yours : the revellings and banquetings of this world or quiet communion with God ; ;
the ever burning lusts of the flesh or the powerful victory of Holy Spirit discipline .The choice is yours : God is in your hands , now .God has already set the day when you will be in His hands .What He does with you then depends on what you do with Him now .Then it will be a `` fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God '' if you have abused Him in your hands .
I am a magazine ; ;my name is Guideposts ; ;this issue that you are reading marks my 15th anniversary .When I came into being , 15 years ago , I had one primary purpose : to help men and women everywhere to know God better , and through knowing Him better to become happier and more effective people .That purpose has never changed .
When you read me , you are holding in your hands the product of many minds and hearts .Some of the people who speak through my pages are famous ; ;others unknown .Some work with their hands .Some have walked through pain and sorrow to bring you their message of hope .
Some are so filled with gratitude , for the gift of life and the love of God , that their joy spills out on the paper and brightens the lives of thousands whom they have never known , and will never see .Fifteen years ago , there were no Guideposts at all .This month a million Guideposts will circulate all over the world .Experts in the publishing field consider this astounding .They do not understand how a small magazine with no advertising and no newsstand sale could have achieved such a following .
To me , the explanation is very simple .I am not doing anything , of myself .I am merely a channel for something .What is this something ? ?I cannot define it fully .
It is the force in the universe that makes men love goodness , even when they turn away from it .It is the power that holds the stars in their orbits , but allows the wind to bend a blade of grass .It is the whisper in the heart that urges each one to be better than he is .It is mankind's wistful yearning for a world of justice and peace .All things are possible to God , but He chooses -- usually -- to work through people .
Sometimes such people sense that they are being used ; ;sometimes not .Fifteen years ago , troubled by the rising tide of materialism in the post-war world , a businessman and a minister asked themselves if there might not be a place for a small magazine in which men and women , regardless of creed or color , could set forth boldly their religious convictions and bear witness to the power of faith to solve the endless problems of living .The businessman was Raymond Thornburg .The minister was Norman Vincent Peale .
Neither had any publishing experience , but they had faith in their idea .They borrowed a typewriter , raised about $2,000 in contributions , hired a secretary , persuaded a couple of young men to join them for almost no pay and began mailing out a collection of unstapled leaflets that they called Guideposts .Compared to the big , established magazines , my first efforts seemed feeble indeed .But from the start they had two important ingredients : sincerity and realism .The people who told the stories were sincere .
And the stories they told were true .For example , early in my life , when one of my editorial workers wanted to find out how churches and philanthropic organizations met the needs of New York's down-and-outers , he didn't just ask questions .Len LeSourd went and lived in the slums as a sidewalk derelict for ten days .That was nearly 13 years ago .Len LeSourd is my executive editor today .
Many of you are familiar , I'm sure , with the story of my early struggles : the fire in January , 1947 , that destroyed everything -- even our precious list of subscribers .The help and sympathy that were forthcoming from everywhere .The crisis later on when debts seemed about to overwhelm me .That was when a remarkable woman , Teresa Durlach , came to my aid -- not so much with money , as with wisdom and courage .`` You're not living up to your own principles '' , she told my discouraged people .
`` You're so preoccupied that you've let your faith grow dim .What do you want -- a hundred thousand subscribers ? ?Visualize them , then , believe you are getting them , and you will have them '' ! !And the 100,000 subscribers became a reality .And then 500,000 .
And now a million January Guideposts are in circulation .With our growth came expansion into new fields of service .Today more than a thousand industries distribute me to their employees .They say all personnel have spiritual needs which Guideposts helps to meet .Hundreds of civic clubs , business firms and individuals make me available to school teachers throughout the land .
They say it helps them bring back into schools the spiritual and moral values on which this country was built .Thousands of free copies are sent each month to chaplains in the Armed Forces , to prison libraries and to hospitals everywhere .Bedridden people say I am easy to hold -- and read .Three years ago it became possible to finance a Braille edition for blind readers .Throughout these exciting years I have been fortunate for , although I have never offered great financial inducements , talent has found its way to me : William Boal who so ably organizes business operations ; ;
John Beach who guides circulation ; ;Irving Granville and Nelson Rector who travel widely calling on business firms .Searching for the best in spiritual stories , my roving editors cover not only the country , but the whole world .Glenn Kittler has been twice to Africa , once spending a week with Dr. Albert Schweitzer .Last summer John and Elizabeth Sherrill were in Alaska .
Van Varner recently returned from Russia .Twice a month the editorial staff meets in New York for an early supper , then a long evening of idea-exchange .Around the table sit Protestant , Catholic , and Jew .Each contributes something different , and something important : Ruth Peale , her wide experience in church work ; ;Sidney Fields , years of experience as a New York columnist ; ;
Catherine Marshall LeSourd , the insight that has made her books world-famous and Norm Mullendore , the keen perception of an advertising executive .There are people who travel long distances to assure my continued existence .Elaine St. Johns may fly in from the West Coast for the editorial staff meetings .Starr Jones gets up every morning at five o'clock , milks his family cow , attends to farm chores , and then takes a two-hour train trip to New York .Arthur Gordon comes once a month all the way from Georgia .
We have also seen the power of faith at work among us .Rose Weiss , who handles all the prayer-requests that we receive , answering each letter personally , has the serene selflessness that comes from suffering : she has had many major operations , and now gets about in a limited way on braces and crutches .Recently , John Sherrill was stricken with one of the deadliest forms of cancer .We prayed for John , during surgery , we asked others to pray ; ;all over the country a massive shield of prayer was thrown around him .
Today the cancer is gone .Perhaps it is not fair to mention some people without mentioning all .But , you see , those who are not mentioned will not resent it .That is the kind of people they are .Perhaps you think the editorial meetings are solemn affairs , a little sanctimonious ? ?
Not so .Serious , yes , but also much laughter .Sharp division of opinion , too , and strenuous debate .There are brain-wracking searches for the right word , the best phrase , the most helpful idea .And there is also something intangible that hovers around the table .
A good word for it is fellowship .A shorter word is .Each meeting starts with a prayer , offered spontaneously by one member of the group .It takes many forms , this prayer , but in essence it is always a request for guidance , for open minds and gentle hearts , for honesty and sincerity , for the wisdom and the insights that will help Guideposts' readers .For you , readers , are an all-important part of the spiritual experiment that is Guideposts .
I need your support , your criticism , your encouragement , your prayers .I am a magazine ; ;my name is Guideposts .My message , today , is the same as it was 15 years ago : that there is goodness in people , and strength and love in God .May He bless you all .
Havana was filled with an excitement which you could see in the brightness of men's eyes and hear in the pitch of their voices .The hated dictator Batista had fled .Rumors flew from lip to lip that Fidel Castro was on his way to Havana , coming from the mountains where he had fought Batista for five years .Already the city was filled with Barbudos , the bearded , war-dirty Revolutionaries , carrying carbines , waving to the crowds that lined the Prado .And then Castro himself did come , bearded , smiling ; ;
yet if you looked closely you'd see that his eyes did not pick up the smile on his lips .At first I was happy to throw the support of our newspaper behind this man .I am sure that Castro was happy , too , about that support .Diario De La Marina was the oldest and most influential paper in Cuba , with a reputation for speaking out against tyranny .My grandfather had been stoned because of his editorials .
