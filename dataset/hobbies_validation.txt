Working in a vacuum of minimal information can result only in show pieces that look good in exhibitions and catalogs and may please the public relations department but have little to do with the essence of interior design .It is possible , of course , to work on extant or projected buildings where either architect or owner will explain their necessities so that the student may get `` the feel '' of real interior design demands .
Unfortunately , the purely synthetic problem is the rule .It is like medical schools in India where , in that fairy-land of religious inhibition , the dissection of dead bodies is frowned upon .
Instead they learn their dissection on the bulbs of plants .Thus technical efficiency is achieved at the expense of actual experience .
In the earlier years of training certain phases of the work must be covered and the synthetic problem has its use .But to continue to divorce advanced students from reality is inexcusable .
Consultation with architects , clients , real estate men , fabric houses and furniture companies is essential to the proper development of class problems just as in actual work .Fortunately , although only a few years ago they held the student at arms length , today the business houses welcome the opportunity to aid the student , not only from an increased sense of community responsibility but also from the realization that the student of today is the interior designer of tomorrow -- that the student already is `` in the trade '' .
Even the `` history of furniture '' can hardly be taught exclusively from photographs and lantern slides .Here , too , the reality of actual furniture must be experienced .
The professional organizations such as American Institute of Interior Designers , National Society of Interior Designers , Home Fashions League and various trade associations , can and do aid greatly in this work .Certainly every educator involved in interior design should be a member and active in the work of one of these organizations .
Not only should every educator above the rank of instructor be expected to be a member of one of the professional organizations , but his first qualification for membership as an educator should be so sharply scrutinized that membership would be equivalent to certification to teach the subject .Participation for the educator in this case , however , would have to be raised to full and complete membership .
The largest of these organizations at present denies to the full time educator any vote on the conduct and standards of the group and , indeed , refuses him even the right to attach the customary initials after his name in the college catalog .This anomalous status of the educator cannot fail to lower his standing in the eyes of the students .
The professor in turn dares not tolerate the influence in his classes of an organization in the policies and standards of which he has no voice .This seems somewhat shortsighted since if the absolute educational qualifications for membership which the organizations profess are ever enforced , the educator will have the molding of the entire profession in his hands .
In one way the Institutes and Societies do a disservice to the schools .That is in the continuance of the `` grandfather clauses '' in their membership requirements .
When these groups were first formed many prominent and accomplished decorators could not have had the advantage of school training since interior design courses were rare and undeveloped during their youth .Long hard years of `` on the job '' training had brought them to their competence .
The necessity of that day has long disappeared .There is plenty of opportunity for proper education today .
It is discouraging for students to realize that the societies do not truly uphold the standards for which they are supposed to stand .The reason and the day of `` grandfather clauses '' has long since passed .
No one can deny that these `` back door '' admissions to membership provisions have been seriously abused nor that they have not resulted in the admission of downright incompetents to membership in supposedly learned societies .Beyond any question of curriculum and approach to subject must be the quality of the teachers themselves .
It will occur to anyone that the teacher must have adequate education , a depth and breadth of knowledge far beyond the immediate necessities of his course plus complete dedication to his subject and to his students .The local decorator who rushes in for a few hours of teaching may but more likely may not have these qualifications .
Nor will the hack , the Jack-of-all-trades , still found in some of the smaller art schools , suffice .Only a few years ago a middle western college circulated a request for a teacher of interior design .
At the end of its letter was the information that applicants for this position `` must also be prepared to teach costume design and advertising art '' .This kind of irresponsibility toward their students can scarcely build a strong professional attitude in the future designer .
We must build a corps of highly professional teachers of interior design who have had education , experience in the profession and are willing to take on the usual accompaniments of teaching -- minimal income and minimal status among their confreres .Considerable specialization in teaching subjects such as architecture , furniture design , textiles and color is also desirable .
In all `` degree '' courses in interior design a number of `` academic '' or `` general studies '' courses are included .It is only fair to demand that teachers of courses in English , history , psychology and so on be as well informed in matters of art , especially interior design , as are the art teachers educated in the academic subjects .
The proper correlation of the art with the academic can be achieved only if this standard is observed .The matter of sympathy of the academic professors for art objectives also must be taken into account .
One technical question of school organization comes to mind here .For proper accreditation of schools , teachers in any course must have a degree at least one level above that for which the student is a candidate .
Since there are almost no schools in the country offering graduate work in interior design this rule cannot at present be observed .Indeed , it has only been a matter of the last few years that reputable schools of art have granted degrees at all .
The question , however , cannot be ignored for long .The basic problem involved is that a college setting up a graduate school must have an entirely separate faculty for the advanced degree .
Most professors in the course must , naturally , again have a higher degree than the course offers .One solution is the aquisition of degrees in education but it is a poor substitute .
It is a sort of academic ring-around-a-rosy and you solve it .This brings us to the question of accreditation of art schools in general .
Only the independent art schools , that is , those not connected with any university or college , receive severe and separate investigation before accreditation by the various regional organizations .It has been the custom for most universities to stretch the blanket of accreditation for their liberal arts school to cover the shivering body of their fine arts department .
This , plus the habit of many schools of simply adding interior design to the many subjects of their home economics department , yet , nevertheless , claiming that they teach interior design , has contributed to the low repute of many university courses in interior design .In spite of this , many universities offer adequate and even distinguished courses in the subject .
There will be no mitigation of these offences until all art schools , whether independent or attached to universities have separate accreditation -- as do medical schools -- by an art accreditation group such as the `` National Association of Schools of Art '' .Independent art schools granting degrees must , naturally , follow this with academic accreditation by the appropriate regional group .

A program to fit your needsConsider what you can afford to spend and what your goals are before setting up or revamping your employee benefit program .
Too many plant officials are all too eager to buy a package program from an insurance company simply because it works for another plant .But even if that other plant employs the same number of workers and makes the same product , there are other facts to consider .
How old is your working force ? ?What's your profit margin ? ?
In what section of the country are you located ? ?Are you in a rural or urban area ? ?
These factors can make the difference between waste and efficiency in any benefit program .Above all , don't set up extravagant fringe benefits just to buy employee good will .
Unions stress fringe benefits , but the individual hourly worker prefers cash every time .Aim to balance your employee benefit package .
Some plants go overboard on one type of fringe -- say a liberal retirement plan -- and find themselves vulnerable elsewhere .They're asking for union trouble .
CommunicationsIf you want credit for your employee services program , let your workers know what they're entitled to .
Encourage them to exercise their benefits .This can be done by stories in your house organs , posters , special publications , letters to workers' homes as well as by word of mouth through your chain of command .
Some companies find a little imagination helpful .Hallmark Cards , Inc. , Kansas City , Mo. , has a do-it-yourself quiz game called `` Benefit Bafflers '' , which it distributes to employees .
M & R Dietetic Laboratories , Inc. , Columbus , gives all its workers a facsimile checkbook -- each check showing the amount the company spends on a particular fringe .U. S. Rubber Company , New York , passes out a form itemizing the value of benefits .
The blue-collar worker thus knows his insurance package , for example , costs $227.72 .Insurance
Have the insurance company or your own accounting department break down the cost of your insurance package periodically .You may find certain coverage costing much more than is economically feasible , thereby alerting you to desirable revisions .
Check to see if some of your benefits -- such as on-the-job disability pay -- can be put on a direct payment rather than an insured basis at a savings to you .Use deductable insurance wherever feasible .
It can put an end to marginal claims which play havoc with your insurance rates .Also , beware of open-end policies , especially in the medical field .
This will mean that every time there's an increase in hospital rates your cost will go up in like manner .Put a dollar-and-cents limit on benefits .
Don't go overboard on insurance that pays benefits only upon death .Generally , your employee will greatly appreciate benefits that protect him during his working life or during retirement .
Special time offIn granting bereavement leaves , specify the maximum time off and list what the worker's relation to the deceased must be to qualify .
Thus , you avoid headaches when an employee wants off for his fourth cousin's funeral .Also , reserve the right to demand proof of death despite the fact that you'll probably never use it .
Coffee breaks can be a real headache if not regulated .Vending machines can alleviate the long hike to the cafeteria during the break with resulting waste of production time .
If coffee is sold at the cafeteria , let a few workers in each department get it for the whole group .Consider installing supplemental serving lines in production areas .
Make sure milk for the coffee is placed in dispensers rather than in containers , if you are supplying the coffee .Otherwise , you may be saddled with a good-size milk bill by milk drinkers .
Retirement policiesKeep the retirement age flexible so skilled craftsmen such as tool and die makers can be kept on the job for the convenience of the company .
And so deadheads on the payroll can be eased out at the earliest possible age .Make sure you have minimum age and time-on-the-job requirements tied into your pension plan .
Younger men usually don't think of pensions as an important job benefit factor anyhow and they're liable to change jobs several times before settling down .Choose carefully between contributory or non-contributory pension plans .
There are two sides of a coin for this decision .Workers usually think more of a plan they contribute to .
And they can at least collect the money they put in , plus interest , when they leave the company .A non-contributory plan usually won't pay off for the worker until he retires .
Thus , there is an added incentive to stay on the job .Holidays
Make sure you don't pay for holidays that occur when an employee would not otherwise be working .These include : leaves of absences , illnesses , and layoffs .
Consider adopting a system of holidays in which time off is granted with an eye to minimum inconvenience to the operation of the plant .It's usually not too hard to sell workers on this as it gives them longer holiday periods .
For example , the Friday after Thanksgiving can be substituted for Washington's birthday .This reduces the number of expensive plant shutdowns and startups .
Require each employee to work his last shift both before and after the holiday to be eligible for pay .This cuts the absentee rate .
Eating facilitiesConsider using vending machines rather than subsidized cafeterias .
Latest models serve hot meals at reasonable prices , and at a profit to you .If a concessionaire runs the cafeteria , keep an eye out for quality and price .
If the soup tastes like dishwater , your employees won't blame the concessionaire .You'll take the rap .
Check your cafeteria location to make sure it's convenient for most employees .You may save valuable production minutes with a change .
VacationsSpread your vacation period over the widest possible span of time or shut the plant down for two weeks .
This will cut the expense of vacation replacements .And with the shutdown method there will be no argument as to who gets the choice vacation dates .
Also make sure you have reasonable requirements as to hours worked before a production employee is entitled to a vacation .You might try providing standard vacation time off but make the vacation pay depend on the number of hours worked in the previous year .
The long and ever-increasing column of sportsmen is now moving into a new era .Modern times have changed the world beyond recognition .
The early years of the twentieth century seem very far away .But with all the changes in philosophy , dress and terrain -- a few things remain constant , including the devotion of Americans to the great field sports , hunting and fishing .
As the generations move on , clothes become more suitable for the enjoyment of outdoor sports .Sporting firearms change , markedly for the better .
Just as modern transportation has outmoded the early Studebaker covered wagon , the demand of today's sportsmen and women has necessitated changes in their equipment .The American firearms and ammunition manufacturers through diligent research and technical development have replaced the muzzle loader and slow-firing single-shot arms with modern fast firing auto-loaders , extremely accurate bolt , lever , and slide action firearms .
And millions of rounds of entirely new and modern small-arms ammunition , designed for today's hunting and target shooting .And due to modern resource-use and game management practices , there is still game to shoot , even with the ever-expanding encroachment on land and water .
Present conservation practices regard wildlife , not as an expendable natural resource , but as an annual harvest to be sown and also reaped .Unlimited game bags are possible and legal in more than 40 states , on shooting preserves ( one of the newer phases of modern game-management ) for five and six months each year .
Close to two million game birds were harvested on 1,500 commercial and private shooting preserves , and on State Game Commission-controlled upland game areas during the 1960-61 season .The shooting development program of the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute has successfully published these facts in all major outdoor magazines , many national weeklies and the trade papers .
The most effective way to develop more places for more sportsmen to shoot is to encourage properly managed shooting preserves .This has been the aim of the director of the shooting development program , the New York staff of the Sportsmen's Service Bureau , and the SAAMI shooting preserve field consultants since the start of the program in 1954 .
Following the kick-off of SAAMI's shooting development program in 1954 , a most interesting meeting took place in Washington , D.C. .The group known as the American Association for Health , , Physical Education , and Recreation ( a division of the National Education Association ) initiated a conference which brought together representatives of the National Rifle Association , SAAMI and the American Fishing Tackle Manufacturers .
This meeting was called to determine how these groups might cooperate to launch what is known as the Outdoor Education Project .The Outdoor Education Project took cognizance of the fact , so often overlooked , that athletic activities stressed in most school programs have little or no relationship to the physical and mental needs and interests of later life .
The various team sports assuredly have their place in every school , and they are important to proper physical development .But with the exception of professional athletes , few contact sports and physical education activities in our schools have any carryover in the adult life of the average American man or woman .
Following a vigorous campaign of interpretation and leadership development by OEP director Dr. Julian Smith , today thousands of secondary schools , colleges and universities have shooting and hunting education in their physical education and recreation programs .SAAMI's financial support since 1955 has contributed to the success of this project in education .
Personnel assigned through the shooting development program have proudly participated in over 53 state and regional workshops , at which hundreds of school administrators , teachers , professors , and recreational leaders have been introduced to Outdoor Education .Considering that the current school-age potential is 23 million youths , the project and its message on hunting and shooting education have many more to reach .
In 1959 SAAMI's shooting development program announced a new activity designed to expose thousands of teen-age boys and girls to the healthy fun enjoyed through the participation in the shooting sports .This program is now nationally known as `` Teen Hunter Clubs '' .
Teen Hunter Clubs were initially sponsored by affiliated members of the Allied Merchandising Corporation .The first program was sponsored by Abraham & Strauss , Hempstead , New York , under the direction of Special Events director Jennings Dennis .
Other pilot programs were conducted by A & S , Babylon , New York ; ;J. L. Hudson , Detroit ; ;
Joseph Horne , Pittsburgh .Other THC activities followed , conducted by shopping centers , department stores , recreation equipment dealers , radio-TV stations , newspapers , and other organizations interested in the need existing to acquaint youngsters with the proper use of sporting firearms and the development of correct attitudes and appreciations related to hunting and wise use of our natural resources .
SAAMI's field men have served as consultants and/or have participated in 75 Teen Hunter Club activities which have reached over 40,000 enthusiastic young Americans .Through the efforts of SAAMI's shooting development program these shooting activities , and many others , including assists in the development of public and privately financed shooting parks , trap and skeet leagues , rifle and pistol marksmanship programs have been promoted , to mention only a few .
The continuation and expansion of the shooting development program will assure to some degree that national and community leaders will be made aware of the ever-growing need for shooting facilities and activities for hunting and shooting in answer to public demand .While individual sportsmen are aware of this situation , too many of our political , social , educational and even religious leaders too often forget it .
Help is needed from dealers , at the grass-roots level .The American gun and ammunition producers sponsor a successful promotional program through their industry trade association .
Since SAAMI's conception in 1926 , and more specifically since the adoption of the Shooting Development Program in 1954 , millions of dollars and promotional man-hours have gone into the development of more places to shoot for more youths and adults .We trust that you , as a gun and ammunition dealer , have benefited through additional sales of equipment .
Are you getting top dollar from the shooting sports ? ?Are you looking ahead to the exploding market of millions of American boys and girls , who will grow up to enjoy a traditional American way of life -- ranging the fields with a fine American gun and uniformly excellent ammunition ? ?
Is your sporting firearms and ammunition department primed for the expanding horizons ? ?Would you like to organize Teen Hunters Clubs , shooting programs , and have information on seasons including six months of hunting with unlimited game bags on shooting preserves ? ?
Ask Sammy Shooter .We were camping a few weeks ago on Cape Hatteras Campground in that land of pirates , seagulls and bluefish on North Carolina's famed Outer Banks .
This beach campground with no trees or hills presents a constant camping show with all manner of equipment in actual use .With the whole camp exposed to view we could see the variety of canvas shelters in which Americans are camping now .
There were umbrella tents , wall tents , cottage tents , station wagon tents , pup tents , Pop tents , Baker tents , tents with exterior frames , camper trailers , travel trailers , and even a few surplus parachutes serving as sunshades over entire family camps .Moving around camp we saw all kinds of camp stoves , lanterns , coolers , bedding , games , fishing tackle , windbreaks and sunshades .
We saw similar displays in the other three campgrounds in this 70-mile-long National Seashore Recreation Area .Dealers would do well to visit such a campground often , look at the equipment and talk with the campers .
Here you begin to appreciate the scope of the challenges and possibilities facing the industry .Camping is big and getting bigger .
No one knows where it will stop .Almost every official who reflects on it thinks this movement of Americans to canvas dwellings opens one of the most promising of all outdoor markets .
You read various guesses on how many Americans are camping .The number depends on who is talking at the moment .
The figures range as high as 15 million families .I've heard 10 million mentioned often , but I'm more inclined to think there may be a total of some five to seven million families camping .
Seven million families would total 30 million Americans or more .Consider the equipment needed to protect this many from the weather , to make their cooking easy and their sleeping comfortable .
More campers than campsitesHarassed state park officials often have more campers than they know what to do with .
They are struggling to meet the demand for camping space , but families are being turned away , especially on holiday weekends .The National Parks , always popular camping places , are facing the same pressure .
The National Park Service hopes by 1966 to have 30,000 campsites available for 100,000 campers a day -- almost twice what there are at present .The U.S. Forest Service cares for hundreds of thousands of campers in its 149 National Forests and is increasing its facilities steadily .
But the campers still come .They bring their families and tents and camp kitchens and bedding .
They bring their fishing rods and binoculars and bathing suits .They come prepared for family fun because Americans in ever-growing numbers are learning that here is the way to a fine economical vacation that becomes a family experience of lasting importance .
Why they keep comingThere are a half dozen reasons helping to account for the migration to the campgrounds .
Among them , according to the U.S. Department of Commerce , are : ( 1 ) shorter work weeks , ( 2 ) higher pay , ( 3 ) longer paid vacations , ( 4 ) better transportation , ( 5 ) earlier retirement , and ( 6 ) more education .The more people learn about their country , the more they want to learn .
Camping is family fun , and it is helping more Americans see more of the country than they ever saw before .But make no mistake about it , the first reason people turn to camping is one of economy .
Here is the promise of a vacation trip they can afford .The American Automobile Association , computing the cost for two people to vacation by automobile , comes up with an average daily expenditure figure of $29 .
The AAA then splits it down this way : $10.50 for meals , $9.50 for lodging , $7 for gas and oil , and $2 for tips and miscellaneous .What does the camping couple do to this set of figures ? ?
The $9.50 for lodging they save .Because they prepare their own meals they also keep in their pockets a good portion of that $10.50 food bill along with most of the tip money .
The automobile expenses are about the only vacationing cost they can't either eliminate or pare down drastically by camping along the way .Where Americans used to think of a single vacation each summer , they now think about how many vacations they can have .
Long weekends enable many to get away from home for three or four days several times a year .And even if they stay in resorts part of the time , they might , if the right salesman gets them in tow , develop a yearning to spice the usual vacation fare with a camping trip into the wide open spaces .
It would be a mistake to sell those thousands of beginning campers on the idea they're buying the comforts of home .They're not .
Home is the place to find the comforts of home .They're buying fun and adventure and family experiences .
But it would also be a mistake for them not to realize how comfortable camping has become .This is no longer a way of life for the bearded logger and the wandering cowboy .
Today's campers want comforts , and they have them .And this helps explain why so many people are now going camping .
It's fun , and it's easy -- so easy that there is time left after cooking , and tent keeping , for the women to get out and enjoy outdoor fun with their families .Camp meals are no great problem .
Neither are beds , thanks to air mattresses and sleeping bags .Neither are shelters , because there is one to meet the needs of every camper or prospective camper .
But there is still the sometimes complex problem of helping campers choose the best equipment for their individual needs .Throughout history , the man who showed superior performance has become the commander of others -- for good or bad .
Since the Industrial Revolution , when factories emerged , this classical pattern has been followed .Until recently .
There have always been tales of disillusionment -- the competent technician who became an administrator , willingly or not , and found he didn't like it ; ;the scientist who rebelled against the personnel and paper work ; ;
and much more commonly in recent years , the engineer who found that other duties interfered with -- or eliminated -- his engineering contributions .There have been many extremely competent men who have been converted into very incompetent managers or submerged in paper work , to their own and the public's dissatisfaction and loss .
This has been more evident since our products have incorporated astronomically increased technology .The remedies have been many and varied -- attempts to teach management techniques -- either in plant , at special schools , or in university `` crash '' courses -- provision of management-trained assistants or associates .
But the realization has been growing that these are not the complete answer .Some men have no talent for or interest in management ; ;
forcing them into management can only create trouble .The old shop adage still holds : `` A good mechanic is usually a bad boss '' .
Yet our economy clings inexorably to recognition of managerial status as the gage of success .Labor fights to change its collar from blue to white .
All grades of management seek more resounding titles and incomes because of social pressures .As several recent books have over-emphasized , we have become the most status-conscious nation in the world .
What can be done for the `` individual contributor '' who is extremely important -- and likely to be more so -- in the operation of the technically oriented company ? ?He is usually conscious of the social pressures at home and outside ; ;
usually concerned about America's belief that attainment and success are measured in dollars and titles .Yet titles are traditionally given only to management men , and income tends to rise with title .
Even the college professor in America has been affected .It is , as one engineer says , `` indeed a difficult thing for the engineer to accept that he can go as far on his technical merit as he could employing managerial skills .
This difficulty arises even though we can give examples of men who have actually followed this course .This leads one to conclude , as you have , that there is inevitably more prestige in a management position in the minds of our people '' .
Nobody should be more able to answer the questions on this score than engineering vice-presidents and chief engineers .So we asked such men in major companies in the design field to offer their opinions on the `` dual-road-up '' problem -- and more importantly -- their solutions .
In the paragraphs that follow , we quote from 32 men who are identified on the final page .First : what title , what setup ? ?
Among the more familiar plans for dual-channel advancement is that of General Electric .This is not a mutually exclusive plan ; ;
there is no one point in a man's career at which he must select either the technical or the managerial path upward .Further , the management path does not open the door to higher opportunities than are offered by the more technical path .
It is common to shift back and forth , working up through a number of supervisory and individual-contributor positions .Actually , there are a number of individual-contributor positions in both operating departments and in the company-wide `` services '' operation that are filled by men with successful managerial experience who are currently broadening their capabilities .
Also , moving into a managerial position does not necessarily end a man's recognition as a technical expert .As examples at GE : Glen B. Warren , formerly manager of the Turbine Division , widely recognized as a turbine designer .
The late W. R. G. Baker , a pioneer in television design and long-time vp & gm of the Electronics Division , and later , by his own choice , an individual consultant .Harold E. Strang , expert in switchgear design , for a long period vp & gm of the Measurements & Industrial Products Division , and who currently , approaching retirement , is vice-president and consulting engineer in the Switchgear & Control Division .
In the GE plan , a number of individual contributors have positions and compensation higher than those of many managers .These positions carry such titles as :
Consultant , Advanced DevelopmentConsulting Engineer ,
Consulting Engineer , Heat TransferConsulting Electrical Engineer ,
Senior Electrical Engineer ,Senior Physicist .
Westinghouse has a similar system , with two classifications representing various levels of competence on the strictly technical side : consulting engineer or scientist , as the case may be , and advisory engineer or scientist .Many companies have systems , particularly in R & D , which work more or less well , depending upon size and actual belief in the policy on the part of administration , as will be abundantly apparent in subsequent quotations .
Another factor that may hold hope is for parallel recognition is , as one man says it : `` that the fad for educating top people along managerial lines is yielding to the technically trained approach '' .Senior staff engineer ? ?
One company instituted , early in 1959 , a vertical classification system consisting of four levels .There is no formal equivalence to the supervisory ranks ; ;
the top non-supervisory level , senior staff engineer , enjoys status and pay ranging up to that for the second level of engineering supervision .The second level , senior engineer , rates slightly below first-level supervision .
The expectation is that first-level supervisors will be selected in approximately equal numbers from the second and third engineering level , with very few coming from the first level .The company expects to extend upward both compensation and status for non-supervisory engineers , but probably not into executive levels .
In this organization , about half of the engineers with 15 or more years of employment are in supervision , engineering or elsewhere .This reflects the very heavy engineering content of the products -- which are not military .
Several other examples : central and satellite`` We have over 20 divisions -- each of which has an engineering department headed by a chief engineer .
We have set up a central R & D department , as well as engineering-management departments -- about 80 people working on problems related to those of our plants .A separate research department is , of course , confined to new or future designs .
Part of this headquarters staff , however , are engineering managers who work between divisional chief engineers and headquarters management .These headquarters engineers , headed by the vice-president -- Engineering , counsel and advise divisional managers and chief engineers on product problems as well as aid with design ; ;
and many are engineers who have been advanced from the divisions .These men are considered managers of engineers .
They must learn to wear several hats , so to speak , working with management , sales and engineering problems related to the product .`` We do not have people in our organization termed ' consultants ' or ' fellows ' , who are specialists in one particular technical subject .
I suppose it is because we are just not big enough .We have a few ' consultants ' -- retired engineers retained and called in on certain problems .
The only ' fellows ' in our company are those who have been honored by ASME , AIEE or AIChE .I am sure that the engineer who enters management is nearly always opening the door to greater possibilities than he would have as a technical specialist -- because of his wider accountability '' .
Another structure`` We have tried to make both paths attractive , so that good men could find opportunity and satisfaction in either .
One way to formalize this is in the job structure .We have these positions , which compare directly : Af
`` Above these jobs we have chief engineer for the company and vice-president of Engrg , R & Aj .The latter jobs include major management responsibilities and have been filled by those who have come up primarily through the engineering-management side .
We have not yet succeeded in establishing recognition of technical specialization comparable to our higher levels of management , but I believe we will trend in this direction but not to exceed vice-president '' .Top job : research scientist
`` .Approximately four years ago , we initiated a dual ladder of advancement for technical persons .
The highest position is known as a ' research scientist .This approach has not been entirely satisfactory .
The primary deterrent appears to lie with the technical people themselves , and their concept of what constitutes status in present-day society .Scientists who agitate hardest for technical recognition are often the most reluctant to accept it .
We have discovered that the outward trappings such as private offices and private secretaries are extremely important ; ;and although we have attempted to provide these status symbols , support of the ' dual-ladder ' plan has been half-hearted despite the creation of a salary potential for a research scientist commensurate with that of men in top managerial positions .
`` A serious problem accompanying the technical-ladder approach is the difficulty of clearly defining responsibilities and standards of performance for each level .With no set standards , there is the tendency to promote to the next highest level when the top of a salary band is reached regardless of performance .
Promotion is too often based on longevity and time in salary grade instead of merit .If no specific organization plan exists limiting the number of scientists at each salary level , the result is a department top-heavy with high-level , high-salaried personnel '' .
Staff engineer dept. manager`` We have two approaches for the technical man : the position of staff engineer , which is rated as high in salary as department manager ; ;
and an administrative organization to take the routine load away from department managers and project engineers as much as possible , thus allowing them more time for strictly technical work .These are only halfway measures , and the answer will come when some way is found to allow the technical man in industry to progress without limit in salary and prestige '' .
A complete plan`` We have made limited application of the ' parallel ladder ' plan .
The highest rated non-supervisory engineering title is ' research engineer .The salary schedule permits remuneration greater than the average paid to the first level of engineering supervision ( engineering section head ) .
We also have an ' engineering section head -- research engineer ' classification which has salary possibilities equivalent to that of a research engineer .Above this point there is no generally used parallel ladder .
`` We also do a number of things to build up the prestige of the engineer as a ' professional ' and also to give public recognition to individual technical competence .These include encouragement of , and assistance to , the engineer in preparation and publication of technical papers .
We have two media for publicizing individual technical activity , a magazine widely distributed both within and without the company , and an information bulletin for engineering personnel distributed to the homes of all engineers .Publicity is given to the award of patents to our engineers and financial support is provided for individual membership in technical societies .
`` A recent , and more pertinent action , has been the establishment of a technical staff reporting to the vice-president for Engineering .This function is staffed by engineers chosen for their technical competence and who have the title , member of the technical staff .
Salaries compare favorably with those paid to the first two or three levels of management .Additional symbols of status are granted , such as reserved parking , distinctive badge passes authorizing special privileges , and a difference in the treatment of financial progress through merit .
`` We presently are involved in inaugurating a new development center .Operations of this nature offer the best opportunity to recognize scientific status .
All scientific staff members will have the title , ' research-staff member .The salary level of an individual within the group will reflect the scientific community's acceptance of him as an authority in his scientific field .
Contrary to usual organization-position evaluations , the position to which research-staff members report administratively will not necessarily encompass the duties of the research-staff member , therefore , are not necessarily evaluated as highly .`` These recent steps do not offer the possibility of extension to the great number of senior engineers who have displayed technical competence .
It is doubtful that the complete solution to the over-all problem can result entirely from company efforts .Fundamental to the difficulty of creating the desired prestige is the fact that , in the business community , prestige and status are conferred in proportion to the authority that one man has over others and the extent of which he participates in the management functions '' .
Sixty miles north of New York City where the wooded hills of Dutchess County meet the broad sweep of the Hudson River there is a new home development called `` Oakwood Heights '' .As a matter of fact you could probably find a new home development in every populated county in the country with three-bedroom ranch style cottages in the $14,000 range .
But Oakwood Heights is unique in one particular .Its oil for heating is metered monthly to each home from a line that starts at a central storage point .
This is a pilot operation sponsored by a new entity chartered in Delaware as the Tri-State Pipeline Corporation , with principal offices in New York State .Its president is Otis M. Waters , partner in the law firm of Timen & Waters , 540-K Chrysler Bldg. , New York City .
Vice-president is Louis Berkman and the secretary-treasurer is Mark Ritter .Ritter is the builder of Oakwood Heights and president of Kahler-Craft Distributors , Inc. , Newburgh , N.Y. .
The idea of a central tank with lines to each house is not in itself a novelty .Not a year goes by but what several local companies in the U.S. and Canada , even overseas , write to Fueloil & Oil Heat to inquire if it's feasible and where it is being done .
Its editors only knew of one example to point to , a public housing development of 278 homes in New Haven described by John Schulz in the March , 1950 issue .This has survived the years but there has been considerable concern among the tenants over the fact that the oil was not metered .
Rather the monthly total consumption was divided and charged on the basis of number of rooms and persons in the family .Common complaints included `` Mrs. Murphy '' leaving her windows open all the time , a fresh air fan , or the family was visiting `` Aunt Minnie '' with the house shut up but they still paid the same rate for oil .
As a result of that attitude , others have been discouraged from trying central distribution .A new low capacity meter is the key that unlocks the situation at Oakwood Heights .
Called a `` Slo-Flo '' meter it was designed for this job by Power Plus Industries of Los Angeles , a key individual being Don Nelson .Tri-State has acquired its exclusive distribution for the northern , principal heating states .
There's an advantage in having a firm like Tri-State headed by a lawyer .The earlier New Haven development was public housing , so it easily leaped over the problems met in a private venture .
These have to do with property rights , municipal official attitudes and a host of others .In working out the practical legal conclusions President Waters was not thinking only of this pilot project , for it is planned to duplicate this program or system in other builder developments nationally .
It is always difficult , or at least time-consuming , to get approval of any kind of line under a public street , as one example .To overcome this , the builder lays and completes the street himself , then deeds it to the community while retaining a perpetual easement for the oil lines .
When a family buys a home the title is subject to a perpetual easement to Tri-State .For the central storage , Tri-State buys one acre , Buries its tanks and simply holds permanent title to that piece .
In other words , the whole storage and pipeline system does not belong to the homeowners nor to the town but rather to Tri-State .How does Tri-State get its revenue from this plan ? ?
It leases the whole facility to a large oil company , at least large enough to have a strong credit position .This first test is being leased for ten years but future projects will require at least 15 years .
The amount paid by the oil company to Tri-State for the use of its oil distribution system and the privilege of supplying all the homes , is subject to negotiation but naturally must be profitable to both parties .On this first venture the central storage is 20,000 gallons , in two tanks , or an average of 400 gallons for each of the 50 homes .
The supplier delivers at his convenience in transport loads , so as to maintain two-to-three weeks reserve supply against weather contingencies .However , that is not all he has to do .
He must undertake complete servicing of the oilheating equipment to assure fine heating .In the present project the heating is by circulating hot water from Paragon boiler-burner units with summer-winter domestic hot water hookups .
Again , the oil man must read the meters at such intervals as he finds best .For this first development the supplier signing the lease is a major oil company but in turn the deal is being transferred for operation to its local fueloil distributor .
The major gets the assured gallonage for the life of the lease and the distributor apparently can do well because delivery cost is low .Initial considerations
The officers of the new corporation have naturally explored many angles , as well as personalities that might be affected .For example , the officials of Poughkeepsie town ( township ) where the project is located think highly of it because it simplifies their snow clearing problem .
The central storage is near a main artery quite easy to reach with large transports on a short crescent swing , with fewer trucks in the residential streets .The Public Service Commission has ruled that this is not a public utility , subject to their many regulations .
Several financial institutions , both banks and insurance companies , have been sounded out .They like it and would supply most of the capital because of the long term leases by strong oil companies .
The Government housing agencies consider it feasible with one special stipulation .There must be a restriction in the deed to provide that the customer may not be charged more than the current market price for the oil , an obvious precaution , since the account is permanently wedded , just like with gas or electricity .
For a few details of the system the lines are 1-1/4'' '' X-Tru-Coat , a product of Republic Steel Corp. , and all lines are welded .They are laid a minimum of 24'' '' deep and in some areas four feet down , particularly under roads , to stay clear of all other piping such as water and sewers and to minimize shocks from heavy trucking .
The meter is mounted high on the basement wall .Its figures are a half inch high and very easy to read , even into tenth gallons .
It will accommodate firing rates as low as a half gallon an hour .Ritter , the builder , is convinced that the total cost of all the heating systems plus the oil distribution system is no greater than would be gas heating systems in the houses plus their lines and meters .
He believes that this is a sound approach to gas competition in builder developments where gas is available .It would be pretty difficult to install a Tri-State system in old neighborhoods , and that's an understatement .
The job of getting property easements and street easements and the acre for the tanks would become pretty discouraging .But in a new development where everything starts from scratch the solutions are simple .
Future plansWhat does Tri-State actually want to do , now that it has the meters under franchise and certain phases of its piping system in the `` patent applied for '' stage ? ?
It wants to interest builders and oil companies in the idea of including its facility in their new home projects , by financing and installing the storage , piping and meters , and leasing these for 15 years , with renewal options , to a strong oil company .It may also work in one other way -- by licensing its system patents and supplying the meters , letting the oil company or even the builder install the facilities .
This whole development is certain to be of interest to the readers , for the idea has so often been mentioned , somewhat wistfully .But it's too early yet to go visit Oakwood Heights .
Only eight of the 50 houses were completed at the time of the editor's visit on June 8th ; ;others were building .
The big tanks were at the site but still sunning themselves .A big mechanical ditcher was running the trenches , and the town building inspector was paying a friendly , if curious , visit .
The oilheating industry is looking up , led by a revival of research and development .A primary ingredient in these fields is imagination , and Tri-State Pipeline Corporation deserves a very good mark .
Every year about this time National Gargle Your Cooling System week rolls around .It pays in the long ( hot ) run to take good care of the water works .
Do it this way for the summer gargle :First , drain that old coolant down the storm sewer .
Don't save the anti-freeze , even if it the expensive `` permanent '' type .The word means it won't boil away easily , nothing else .
The rust inhibitors in the fluid are used up after one year , and you don't want to risk the rust that two years' use could mean .Pitch it out .
If a lot of rust shows in the drain , use a good flushing cleaner .Then fill the system and add a rust inhibitor .
Of course , you'll want to use the softest water you can in your radiators .Now , check for leaks in your hoses and hose connections , around the freeze-out plugs , gaskets , water pump seals and heater fittings .
Next , run the engine and let it heat up so the thermostat opens , and then look for leaks again .Be sure the bugs and dirt are blown out of the radiator fins .
Use the air hose for this job .Check the temperature gage and be sure it is working .
If you use one of the new year-round cooling system fluids such as `` Dowguard '' be sure to check it .Dow says that the fluid can be used now for two years .
Check its inhibitor effectiveness before leaving it in during the summer .Take precautions now , to be sure you avoid those unpleasant and costly heat breakdowns when the temperature zooms this summer .
Don't let your mechanics pull the thermostats out of those fueloil delivery trucks or installation rigs of yours .Spring and summer may be here officially , but those thermos stay in .
The fact is that removing and leaving out a thermostat from any water cooled vehicle , will greatly increase the fuel consumption , reduce power and contribute to spark plug fouling due to an accumulation of excessive carbon deposits on the insulators .If you run into excess plug fouling on one truck , check to be sure that the rig has a thermostat .
The thermostat is important to get your engine up to operating temperature quickly , and to keep it running at its most efficient temperature through the proper circulation of the coolant .Are you paying too much for your truck insurance ? ?
There's a good chance you are doubling on some coverage , not taking discounts coming to you and not cutting some corners that can be cut .Have a talk with your insurance agent .
Be careful that you keep adequate coverage , but look for places to save money .First go over the type of coverage you now have .
Look for these features which may mean you can save :Duplicate coverage .
Avoid doubling up on the same item .For example , don't pay in a truck policy for medical coverage that you may be paying for in a health and accident policy .
Does your policy have a lay-up clause ? ?This means that if your insured vehicle is laid up for more than 30 days , insurance can be suspended and a proportionate return of your premium made to you .
This applies to repair work of winter storage .The figure five is important in insurance .
With many company policies you get a fleet discount if you insure five or more rigs .This means either cars or trucks .
Discounts run up to 2% of cost .Usually premium reductions can be obtained by applying deductibles to your liability plan .
For example : If your bodily injury claims start payment after the first $250 , a 25% premium saving is often made .In the period since the end of World War 2 , -- a period coinciding with merchandising demands for the colorful , the unusual , and the original in signs and displays -- plastics have come on so strong that today they are the acknowledged leaders in the field .
The importance of the sign industry to the plastics industry , however , is not in terms of volume alone .Designers of signs and displays have shown a refreshing approach to the adaptation of plastics that has influenced the workings of other industries .
Many of today's developments in thermoforming stem from original work done with signs and displays ; ;the art of preprinting in distortion was similarly perfected by the sign makers ; ;
and the reverse-surface decorating techniques now used for escutcheons , medallions , etc. , owes much to the field , as does the technology of designing with the light-transmitting properties of the transparent plastics .There is much that many industries can continue to learn from some of the more recent developments described below .
The concept of trans-illumination ( as shown by the photo on p. 92 ) , as just one example , offers an entirely new approach to lighting problems -- no matter what industry is involved .A volume market
According to a recent Wall Street Journal survey , plastics units now account for more than 50% of all sign sales .Five years ago , they had only 10% of the market , with the remainder firmly entrenched in the stronghold of neon tubing .
And it's far from the end for plastics .Industry sources are now estimating that 75% of the signs made during the 1960's will be of plastic construction .
Evidence of this trend can best be seen in the recent activities of such leading companies in the field as Advance Neon Sign Co. , Los Angeles , Calif. .Four years ago , the company's entire line was devoted to neon signs ; ;
today , 85% is in plastics .From the volume standpoint , the total market represented by the sign industry is impressive .
Aggregate sales during 1960 reached approximately $500 million .Currently , there are some 6000 companies in the field , ranging from small firms with a handful of employees to major concerns having complete facilities for production of metal , electrical , and plastic components .
Why the trend to plastics ? ?What accounts for the rapid growth of plastics in the sign and display field ? ?
Out of many factors which might be cited , five are most important : 1 .Plastics combine such properties as built-in color , light weight , optional transparency or translucency , resistance to corrosion , as well as the ease of fabrication .
2 .Plastic signs are economical .
According to one major producer , materials for a typical plastic sign are approximately 25% less costly than for a comparable neon unit .Shipping cost is also reduced ; ;
a 3-by-6-ft. plastic sign weighs about 120 lb. , compared to 275-300 lb. for neon .The weight advantage , plus greater durability of the plastic unit , yields a saving of about one-fifth in shipping .
The lighter weight also means less costly supports and mountings are needed .Finally , maintenance costs on plastic signs are much lower than on fragile neon signs .
3 .They offer exceptional design freedom , making it possible to incorporate contours and details which give free range to the talents of the designer .
Vacuum- and pressure-formed sheet plastics fill the gap between cardboard and molded plastics .Pre-decoration , low-cost molds , and the freedom to form large and small , thick and thin materials make plastics tailor-made for the industry .
4 .Plastic signs work around the clock .
Internal illumination , protected from the elements , gives them powerful visual appeal at night ; ;during daylight hours their brilliant colors command attention and interest .
5 .Advances in equipment and fabrication techniques give the sign or display manufacturer an extremely wide choice of production techniques , ranging from injection molding for intricate , smaller-size , mass-production signs ( generally 5000 units is the minimum ) to vacuum and pressure forming for larger signs of limited runs .
Among the newest fabrication methods to enter the display field are expandable styrene molding and blow molding .What plastics to use ? ?
For outdoor signs and displays , acrylic , with its outstanding optical characteristics , weather resistance and formability , strongly dominates the picture .At present , both the familiar cast acrylic and the newer extruded sheets are being used by sign manufacturers , with extruded now representing an estimated 10% of the total .
( See panel , p. 166 , for a comparison .)
Of interest is a recent announcement by Du Pont's Polychemicals Dept. of a new methyl methacrylate monomer designated as Monocite H 100 , which was developed specifically for production of cast acrylic sheets for the sign and lighting industry .Sheeting cast from this material reportedly weighs only one-third as much as glass , is impervious to all kinds of weather , and will not yellow .
Its high impact strength , even at low temperatures , resists chipping , cracking , and crazing , according to Du Pont .Cellulose acetate butyrate is used extensively for vacuum-formed signs , background panels , and molded or formed letters because of its exceptional toughness , ease of forming , and excellent weathering properties .
Its clarity and good optical properties are other important factors .New to the field is a duplex type butyrate laminate in which the two sheets of the laminate are of different color .
Thermoforming the laminate and then sanding away the top layer is a quick and economical way to produce a two-color sign .( see MPl , Mar. 1961 , p. 98 ) .
For specialized types of displays , such as large three-dimensional units reproducing a product , package , human or animal figures , etc. , reinforced plastics and rotationally molded vinyl plastisols are other materials frequently used .A relative newcomer in outdoor signs is Mylar polyester film , now used as a printed overlay for trans-illuminated signs ( see below ) .
For outdoor signs and displays , where the problem of weathering resistance is no longer a factor , the choice of plastics is almost unlimited .Here may be found regular and impact styrene , cellulose acetate , cellulose butyrate and cellulose propionate , acrylic , vinyl , expandable styrene foam , and polyethylene .
The final choice of material depends upon such factors as costs , method of fabrication , degree of complexity , number of units required , time available for tooling , and projected life expectancy of the unit .Often , the finished sign or display incorporates several types of plastics and two or more fabricating techniques .
Trans-illuminated billboardsOne of the most significant advancements in design of plastics signs is the so-called trans-illuminated billboard , now being produced by several large sign manufacturers such as Advance Neon Sign Co. , Los Angeles , and Industrial Electric Inc. , New Orleans , La. .
The essential difference between the new trans-illuminated boards and existing billboards is that the former , constructed of translucent plastic panels , are lighted from within .With the source of light behind the copy , there is no loss of lumen output , as with conventional boards illuminated by means of reflected light .
Also , the light sources are shielded from dirt and weather exposure and cannot obstruct the view of the sign .The copy itself , including any text or illustrations , is reproduced in full color directly on a thin Mylar polyester film by a photo screen process .
The film has an adhesive on the back which permits it to be stripped onto the acrylic panels forming the sign , and also to be stripped off for replacement by new copy as required .Spare sets of face panels simplify the change from one copy or message to another ; ;
new panels are exchanged for the old right in the field on a single trip .Panels with outdated copy are returned to the sign shop so a new message can be applied .
Signs of this type have already made their appearance in several larger cities , and others are on the way .It is believed that these boards will , within the next few years , replace many of the conventional flood-lighted boards now in use .
Trans-illuminated signs also show versatility in other directions .As used by Industrial Electric Inc. , the film panels are printed one at a time , as are 24-sheet posters .
Thus the film can be applied to back-lighted translucent plastics faces ; ;they can also be applied to opaque panels for use on cutouts , or they can be applied directly to painted bulletin faces .
In this way , the sign maker has an economical means for displaying uniform copy on different sign media .Recently Industrial Electric unveiled another new development made possible by modern plastic materials -- a revolving spectacular sign .
Comprised of 16 triangular trans-illuminated plastic sections , it makes it possible to combine three different signs in a single unit .The triangles automatically revolve in a cycle which permits 9 sec. of viewing time for each poster subject .
Sixteen panels , each slightly more than 1-1/2 ft. wide , make up the 25-ft. length of the sign .Changeable letters fill many needs
Perhaps the best way to indicate the versatility of design that characterizes the use of plastics in signs and displays would be to look at what is happening in only one of the areas in this complex field -- changeable signs .Signs are meant to convey a message , and in most cases , this requires words and letters .
Frequently , the message must be changed at intervals to feature new products , price changes , etc. .The huge market for changeable signs has spurred a universal demand for individual plastic letters , in all shapes and sizes -- and a number of companies are set up to supply them .
Here are some of the newer items currently available :Poster Products Inc. , Chicago , Ill. : a changeable copy and display sign which consists of an extruded impact styrene background in choice of colors , onto which are mounted snap-in letters , figures , or words screened on acetate or other types of sheet stock .
The background , which is available in various widths and continuous lengths , is extruded with parallel undercut grooves which grip the flexible letters securely .The Adaptaplex Co. , Beaverton , Ore. : letters molded of butyrate , available in several sizes in either red or black .
Ideal for merchandising use , they are weather-resistant , and have mounting pegs on the back which fit into openings in a vacuum-formed waffle-pattern background panel .For large letters , e.g. thermoformed of acrylic or butyrate , there are other techniques .
For example , in a typical store installation , fifty 24-in. and six 36-in. red acrylic letters were mounted against a white painted wood background .The fact that even the larger letters weighed only 5 lb. each made it possible to secure the letters to the building through clear acrylic angle brackets cemented to the letters .
Stainless steel screws were used to minimize corrosion stains .For mounting to corrugated plastic backgrounds , very small holes may be drilled in the sides of the letters and stainless steel wire threaded through the openings , its ends twisted behind the panels .
Large injection-molded letters are also available for sign installations .Wagner Sign Service Inc. , Chicago , for example , supplies them in several colors , in heights of 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , and 17 inches .
They are molded of a special weather-resistant formulation of Tenite butyrate .Also available from this company are Snug-Grip Plasti-Bars , extruded of transparent acrylic material , which may be cemented to any corrugated acrylic background material .
Made in lengths from 3 to 10 ft. , the bars are shaped in cross section to provide a secure fit for the tapered slots molded in back of the letters .Still another approach to the changeable letter type of sign is a modular unit introduced by Merritt Products , Azusa , Calif. .
This vacuum formed sign is comprised of 27-in. ( or smaller ) panels formed of 0.080-in. clear butyrate sheet stock , masked and sprayed on the rear side .Finished signs are produced by sliding the separate letter panels into channels of 0.025-in. aluminum , which may be mounted to various surfaces .
The sheets are extruded of Tenite butyrate by Jet Specialties Co. , Los Angeles , Calif. .On large-area units , where additional structural requirements are imposed , one recent approach utilizes modular extruded or formed channels ( e.g. right-angled corrugations ) of the acrylic or butyrate .
Joined side by side , such channels make possible construction of continuous two-dimensional luminous areas up to 50 ft. high and of unlimited width .Letters may be wired to the face of the combined channels , painted on the first surface , or handled in other ways .
New rule no. 2 : :Don't build from the outside in -- try to build from the inside out
.Don't insert your components into fixed openings , they may or may not fit ; ;
position your components before you close them in .For example :
Don't wall in your kitchen before you hang the wall cabinets and set the appliances .It's a lot quicker and easier to dimension the kitchen to fit the cabinets and erect the end wall after they are all in place .
Set your bathtub before you close in the end of the bathroom .Don't try to wrestle a 400-lb. tub Af through a narrow doorway .
Finish your plumbing before you frame it in ( most economical framing is a thin non-bearing partition on either side of the pipes ) .Finish installing and connecting up your furnace and your water heater before you wall them in .
There is no better way to waste time than trying to install a furnace in a finished Af closet .Don't position your studs before you insert your windows in conventional construction ; ;
that way you may pay more to shim the window into place than you paid for the window .You can save all that shimming time if you set your windows in one , two , three order -- first the stud on one side , then the window , then the stud on the other side .
Install your disappearing stair ( or stairs ) to the attic and finish your overhead ducts before you drywall the ceiling .Don't close in your house until everything has been carried in .
Last wall Bob Schmitt erects is the wall between the house and garage .That way he can truck his parts right indoors and unload them under the roof .
No auto maker would dream of putting the head on the engine before he fitted the pistons in the block .And trailer makers , those most industrialized and therefore most efficient of homebuilders , say they save hundreds of dollars by always building from the inside out .
New rule no. 3 : rethink everything to get all the big savings the revolution in materials handling offers you.
This revolution is the biggest build-better-for-less news of all , because : 1 .It makes it easy to handle much heavier units , so you can plan to build with much bigger and heavier prefabricated components like those shown in the pictures alongside .
2 .It makes materials handling the only construction cost that ( like earthmoving and roadbuilding ) should be lower today than in 1929 .
3 .It changes the answers to `` Who should do what , and where '' ? ?
It lessens the need for costly on-site fabrication and increases the chance for shop fabrication , where almost everything can be made better and cheaper .4 .
It changes the answers on when to do what at the site .For example , instead of putting in your driveways last ( as many builders do ) you can now save money by putting them in first .
Instead of closing the house in first ( as most builders do ) you can now cut your costs by not closing it in until you have to ( see p 121 ) .5 .
It changes the answers on builder-dealer relations .Not so long ago many builders were finding they could cut their costs by `` buying direct '' and short-cutting the dealer .
But now many of these same builders are finding they can cut their costs more by teaming up with a dealer who has volume enough to afford the most efficient specialized equipment to deliver everything just where it is needed -- drywall inside the house , siding along the sides , trusses on the walls , roofing on the roof , etc. .Says Clarence Thompson : `` We dealers must earn our mark-up by performing a service for the builder cheaper than he could do it himself '' .
The revolution now under way in materials handling makes this much easier .The revolution is well under way , but much more remains to be done
.Five years ago a House & Home Round Table cosponsored by the Lumber Dealers' Research Council reported unhappily :
`` Only one lumber dealer in ten is equipped to handle unit loads ; ;only one box car in eight has the wide doors needed for unit loads ; ;
only one producer in a hundred is equipped to package and ship unit loads ; ;only one builder in a thousand is equipped to receive unit loads .
`` So from raw materials to finished erection the costs of materials handling ( most of it inefficient ) add up to one-fourth of the total construction cost of housing '' .`` That House & Home Round Table was the real starting point for today's revolution in materials handling '' , says Clarence Thompson , long chairman of the Lumber Dealers' Research Council .
`` It made our whole industry recognize the need for a new kind of teamwork between manufacturer , carrier , equipment maker , dealer , and builder , all working together to cut the cost of materials handling .Before that we lumber dealers were working almost single-handed on the problem '' .
Here is where things stand today :1 .
Almost all of the 3,000 lumber dealers who cater primarily to the new-house market and supply 90% of this year's new houses are mechanized .There are few areas left where a builder cannot find a dealer equipped to save him money by delivering everything at lower cost just where his workmen will need it .
2 .Practically all bulky housing products can now be ordered in standard units palletized or unitized for mechanical handling -- including lumber , asphalt shingles , glass block , face brick , plaster , lime , hardboard , gypsum wallboard and sheathing , cement , insulation sheathing , floor tile , acoustical tile , plaster base , and asbestos shingles .
3 .Truck and materials-handling equipment makers now offer specialized units to meet almost every homebuilding need .
For some significant new items see the pictures .4 .
More than 50% of all lumber is unitized ; ;an NLRDA survey found that at least 492 lumber mills will strap their shipments for mechanized handling .
Of these , 376 said they make no extra charge for strapping in standard units , because they save enough on mechanized carloading to offset their strapping cost .Most of the others will swallow their $.50 to $3 charge rather than lose a good customer .
`` With a 15,500-lb. fork-lift , dealers can unload unitized lumber from wide-door box cars for $.30/mbf compared with $1.65 or more to unload loose lumber one piece at a time '' , says James Wright of Aj .5 .
Lumber dealers and lumber manufacturers have agreed on a standard unit for unitized shipments -- 48'' '' wide by a nominal 30'' '' high ( or six McCracken packets 24'' '' wide by nominal 7'' '' high ) .These units make it easy to load as much as 48,000 bd/ft ( say 120,000 lb in a 50' box car ) much more than the average for loose-loaded cars .
6 .The railroads have responded by adding 20,000 more box cars with doors 12' or wider for forklift unloading ( a 21% increase while the total number of box cars was falling 6% ) and by cutting their freight rates twice on lumber shipped in heavily loaded cars .
First was a 1958 cut of more than 50% on that portion of the load in excess of 40,000 lb ; ;later came a 1961 cut on the West Coast ( still pending elsewhere ) of $.07/cwt on 70,000 lb-plus carloads ( which works out to more than $4/mbf on that portion of the load in excess of 70,000 lb .
7 .More unitized lumber is being shipped on flat cars , and NLRDA studies show that flat cars loaded with the new Type 6-B floating-load method can be unloaded for as little as $.054/mbf .
For long hauls these shipments should be protected with water-proof paper .This costs from $.75 to $2.30/mbf , but the cover can pay off if the lumber is to be stored in the open .
These carriers cut handling costs for the dealer -- and the builder.
Says NRLDA's James Wright : `` Since 1958 carriers that move material from the yard to the job site have undergone more radical changes than any of the dealer's other equipment '' .The reason : today's components and lumber packages are far too bulky to be handled by a truckdriver and a helper .
So manufacturers have pioneered a new type of vehicle -- the self-unloading carrier .It cuts the lumber dealer's cost because it takes only one man -- the driver -- to unload it , and because it unloads in a fraction of the time and at a fraction of the cost of hand unloading .
And it helps the builder because it can handle a more efficiently packaged load , can deliver it to the best spot ( in some cases , right on the roof or inside the house ) , and never takes any of the builder's high-priced labor to help unload it .Says Wright : `` Our survey shows that one third of the retail dealers plan to increase the mechanization of their materials handling in the coming two years .
And most of the gain will be in self-unloading vehicles '' .New rule no. 4 : :
Restudy what your men do , to help them waste less of the time you pay for.
Half the manhours you pay for on most jobs are wasted because the job was not planned right , so the right tools were not handy at the right place at the right time , or the right materials were not delivered to the handiest spots or materials were not stacked in the right order for erection , or you bought cheap materials that took too long to fit , or your workmen had to come back twice to finish a job they could have done on one trip .Even `` America's most efficient builder '' , Bob Schmitt of Berea , hopes to cut his labor costs another $2,000 per house as a result of the time-&-motion studies now being completed on his operation by industrial efficiency engineers from the Stanley Works .
Already this study has suggested ways to cut his foundation manhours from 170 to 105 by eliminating idle time and wasted motion .Builder Eddie Carr of Washington , past president of NAHB , cut his bricklaying costs $150 a house by adopting the `` SCR masonry process '' worked out after careful time-&-motion studies by the Structural Clay Products Research Foundation to help bricklayers do better work for less .
A midwestern builder cut his labor costs per thousand bricks from $81 to $43.50 by adopting this same process , cut them another $7.50 to $36 by buying his bricks in convenient , easy-to-spot 100-brick packages .The SCR process , with its precision corner-posts , its precision guide lines , its working level scaffold , and its hand-level brick supply takes eight manhours to get set , but once ready it makes it easy for bricklayers to lay a thousand bricks a day .
See page 156 .One good way to cut your labor waste is to make sure you are using just the right number of men in each crew .
Reports Jim Lendrum : `` By studying men on the job , we found that two men -- a carpenter and a helper -- can lay a floor faster than three .We found that three men -- two carpenters and a helper -- can put up wall panels or trusses more economically than four men -- because four men don't make two teams ; ;
