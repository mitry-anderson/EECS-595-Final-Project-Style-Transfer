`` Deegan '' , the manager said , his voice pitched low , quivering .`` That was a rotten thing to do '' .`` For God's sake '' , Mike said , waving the manager away .`` Stop it , will you ? ?Tell your guys not to block the plate '' .
`` You didn't have to ram him '' .`` That's what you say '' .The Anniston manager looked at Eddie Lee .It was a cold and calculated look .He turned and went back across the field to his dugout .
He called in the pitcher who had been pitching , and a big , heavy , powerfully built right hander moved out to the mound for Anniston .The game started again and in the eighth inning Mike Deegan came up to bat .Everyone in the ball park seemed to be standing and shouting .The first ball the hefty pitcher threw came in for Mike's head .Deegan fell into the dirt , the ball going over him .
He arose slowly and brushed himself off .He got back into the batter's box and on the next pitch dropped into the dirt again .`` Hit the bum '' ! !Somebody yelled from the Anniston bench .In the Riverside dugout Frankie Ricco , shortstop , whispered into Phil's ear : `` There's gonna be a fight '' .
`` Look at those bastards '' ! !Charlie Haydon , a pitcher , said .`` They're looking for trouble '' .Mike was slow getting into the box this time .When he finally did he had to duck his head quickly away as the pitch came in .
`` Listen '' ! !He shouted to the pitcher .`` One more and I'm coming out there '' ! !`` I'll be waiting '' ! !The pitcher yelled back .
Mike Deegan pounded the rubber plate with the end of his bat .He stood flat-footed in the box , but not very close to the plate now .The pitcher wound up and the ball came in straight for Mike's head .Deegan dropped , got up , turned and , holding the bat with both hands up against his chest , began to walk slowly out to the mound .The pitcher tossed his glove away and came towards Mike Deegan .
They were both walking towards each other , unhurried .Riverside and Anniston players rushed out on the field .In the next moment , it seemed , the infield was crowded with spectators , ballplayers , cops , kids and a dog .There was much shouting and screaming .Fights sprang up and were quickly squelched .
Mike and the Anniston pitcher were pulled away before they even came together .Phil Rossoff and two other Riverside players did not go out on the field when the fighting started .After the game , Phil was taking off his sweatshirt in the dressing room when Mike Deegan came in .`` It's a helluva thing '' , Mike said , looking at Phil , `` when a guy's own team-mate won't come out and help him in a fight '' .Phil sighed and pulled the wet sweatshirt over his head .
Frankie Ricco sat down on the bench near Phil .The other players were undressing quietly .Eddie Lee had not come in yet .Mike went over to Phil and stood over him .`` Why the hell didn't you come out when you saw them gang up on me '' ? ?
`` I didn't think it was necessary '' .`` Well ! !Now that's just fine ! !You didn't think it was necessary '' .Mike placed both his hands on his hips .
He pushed his jaw forward .`` Listen , wise guy , if you think I'm gonna do all the fighting for this ball club you're crazy '' .Mike had a good two inches over Phil and Phil had to look up into Mike's face .`` I didn't ask you to fight for the ball club '' , Phil said slowly .`` Nobody else did , either '' .
`` You trying to say I started the fight '' ? ?`` I'm not trying to say anything '' .Phil turned away and opened his locker , and then he heard Mike Deegan say : `` You're yellow , Rossoff '' ! !And Phil banged his locker door shut and spun around .But before anything could happen Frankie Ricco was between them and Eddie Lee had come into the dressing room .
`` Phil , come into my office '' , Eddie said .Phil followed Eddie into the office and shut the door .He sat down before Eddie's desk .`` I'm doing you a favor '' , Eddie said quickly .`` You get your unconditional release as of today '' .
Phil's eyes widened just a trifle .`` The best thing for you to do '' , Eddie said , `` is go home .You don't belong in professional baseball '' .Phil had to clear his throat .`` Is this because of what happened out there '' ? ?
`` No '' , Eddie said .`` But it does confirm what I've suspected all along '' .Phil stood up .`` Listen ! !This is the second time .
''`` Sit down , sit down '' , Eddie said .`` I'm not saying you're yellow .I am saying you're not a professional ballplayer '' .Eddie Lee leaned forward over the desk .
`` Now listen to me , Phil .I'm not steering you wrong .You haven't got the heart for baseball '' .Phil shook his head and Eddie frowned .Suddenly his voice grew hard .
`` What the hell do you think baseball is ? ?You're not in the big leagues , but if you can't give and take down here what the hell do you think it'll be like up there '' ? ?Phil started to say something but Eddie cut him short .`` Now don't tell me what a good ball player you are .I know you've got talent .
But what you haven't got is the heart to back up that talent with .The heart , Phil .You just haven't got the heart for pro-ball , and that's it '' .Dazed , Phil said : `` I don't get it .My batting average ''
Eddie stood up abruptly , then sat down just as abruptly .`` What difference does your batting average make ? ?Or your fielding average .Or even the way you run bases .I tell you when it's necessary to hurt in order to win -- you won't do it .
That's what I mean by no heart for the game .Baseball's no cinch .Deegan had no business ramming into that kid out there .He did it because he knows for each guy he puts out of commission that's one less who might take his job away later on .What the hell do you think baseball is ? ?
A sport ? ?It's a way of life , goddamit ! !And you've got to be ready to cut to ribbons anybody who wants to take your way of life away from you '' ! !He's wrong ! !Phil thought .
It's only his opinion .There were other clubs in this league .He stood up slowly .He was a little pale and shaky .His lips felt glued together .
`` I think you're wrong , Eddie '' , he said finally .Eddie nodded .`` Okay .You'll get your pay in the morning '' .Phil turned and left the room , hearing Eddie say : `` Someday you'll see I was right '' .
Phil shut the door behind him .Outside in the dressing room , Frankie Ricco sat on the bench dressed in his street clothes .`` What happened '' ? ?Frankie asked .Phil said : `` I got my release '' .
`` You crazy '' ? ?Phil shrugged .`` What for '' ? ?Phil sighed .Frankie shook his head .
`` I don't get it '' .`` I don't know '' , Phil said .They were silent for a few moments .Then Frankie said : `` What are you gonna do '' ? ?Phil started to take his clothes off and Frankie sat down on the bench again .
Phil took off one shoe and stared at it .`` Don't take it like this '' , Frankie said .`` Hell , plenty of guys get let out and come back later .The leagues are full of guys like that '' .Phil was very quiet .
`` What are you gonna do , Phil '' ? ?Phil did not answer .`` Why not try another club '' ? ?Phil looked up .What the hell right did Eddie have saying a thing like that ? ?
`` Springfield's in tomorrow '' , Frankie said .`` Talk to Whitey Jackson '' .He just didn't know what he was talking about , saying a thing like that .`` Will you do it , Phil '' ? ?`` Do what '' ? ?
`` Ask Whitey for a job '' .Phil nodded .`` Sure '' , he said .`` Springfield come in tomorrow '' ? ?Frankie nodded .
`` I'll speak to Whitey '' .`` Atta boy '' .`` I'll talk to him , all right '' .`` Don't worry '' , Frankie said .`` You'll get a job there .
He needs outfielders bad '' .`` I'm not worried about it '' , Phil said .`` That's the way to talk .What else did Eddie have to say '' ? ?`` Nothing '' , Phil said .
Richard's next interest seemed the product of his insularity .His broad reading took him into certain by-ways of religion and the subject of religion began to fascinate him .When he was twelve he took to reading St. Augustine and Aquinas , then Lao-tse , Confucius , Mencius , Suzuki , Hindu tomes by endless Krishnaists and numerous socio-archaeological papers .For his birthday , because Richard had seen them in a store and asked for them , his mother bought him the Zend-Avesta and a little image of the Indian god , Acala .And one day , on her own , his mother came home with a present entitled The Book of the Dead , which she suspected Richard would enjoy .
He was enormously happy with her gift and smiled , then went to his room to read .At dinner one night , when he was fourteen , Richard announced , `` There is only one god '' .`` Did you think there were two '' ? ?Grinned his father .`` You don't understand '' , Richard said gloomily .
Through quiet laughter his mother said , `` Don't speak to your father like that , Richard '' .Richard seldom spoke anyhow and he didn't speak to his parents about religion again .His interest in the formal study of religion waned when he was sixteen and he substituted for it an interest in Asian affairs .Although he still didn't speak to anyone , he grew fond of saying , `` The future lies in Asia '' , when the opportunity arose , and when he graduated from high school his parents sent him to New York to give him a foundation , they said , for his life in Asian studies .Richard was a solitary student in New York and acquired , in his remoteness , a thorough if bookish knowledge of Asian lore , literature , life , politics and history .
He was awarded a fellowship to continue his studies in Tokyo and he packed up his clothes , the biwa upon which he had been practicing and his image of Acala , and left to spend a week at home before leaving the country .The week at home was not comfortable .His mother , who had seen little of him for four years , appeared worried about his sailing off by himself for an Orient which , she herself having slight knowledge of it , had to be distrusted .She seemed to work to grow close to her son in the few days he spent at home , talking to him about some of the more pleasant moments of his childhood and then trying to talk to him about those things in which he alone was interested .`` Do you still have The Book of the Dead '' ? ?
She asked him and , laughing , she added , `` I was nervous about buying a book with a title like that , but I knew you'd like it '' .`` Yes '' , he lied to shorten the conversation , `` I still have it '' .He was no longer able to relax in the presence of his parents and found it difficult to keep up a conversation with his mother or father , no matter the subject .As for The Book of the Dead , it along with his other books on religion had been incarcerated in a furnace in the basement of the building in which he had lived in New York .He had dusted each of the books carefully and carried them all to the basement and , trembling at having to open the big furnace , given them up to the flames .
Then he sped from the dark basement and returned to his room and cried .Richard left America with his clothes , his biwa and his image of Acala and , on the freighter which took him to Japan , he plucked at the biwa , trying to make the sounds he wrought resemble an ancient Japanese tune he had once heard .During his second week at sea he brought the curious melody out of the instrument and suddenly wanted to force the biwa to remain at just that moment in its history when it had given him pleasure .He stole from his cabin late that night and crept out into a gusty North Pacific wind and dropped the biwa into the water .It was so dark that he didn't see it hit the water and the noisy rush of the ocean kept him from hearing it .
It was as though the biwa had been eaten up by the wind .In Tokyo Richard took up a life similar to that which he had lived in New York , except that he had replaced his biwa with a friend .An American student named Charlotte Adams had refused to take notice of his evident aversion to people and had at last succeeded in getting him to talk to her .He had nothing much to say to her but that he said anything seemed to please her and he accompanied her on some of her unusually searching tours of Tokyo .In Charlotte , Richard saw a frankness and a zest for doing things which , after a fashion , he envied .
In time , he grew to depend upon her occasional company and she at length was able to encourage him to participate in more social activity .She convinced him that he ought to be a member of some of the small tea-drinking parties she held at her rooms and in the end he complied with her wishes , although it was only rarely that he added anything to the random conversations .At one such gathering Charlotte announced , `` I was at Ryusenji today .Have you ever been to Ryusenji '' ? ?No one had .
`` Well , it's at Fudomae and there was a tan young man , quite naked , taking a shower in the pool .I was thoroughly startled '' .Richard thought it a more promising remark than any made during the last conversation , but Charlotte's manner during the gatherings was more flippant and superficial than when she was alone with him and he was sure her remark would lead to nothing much better than the pointless words which had preceded it .Three of the four persons present , all foreign students in Tokyo , had been playing a game of judging popular Japanese foods by the In and Out system , an equation in which Zen philosophy was used as the modifier .Soba , udon and tea were In because they could be taken noisily .
Sushi was Out because it was pretentious .Sashimi was In , Samuel Burns had suggested , because it was too far Out to stay Out , even if it was a little pretentious .Richard had kept his eyes down throughout the game , the very sound of the chatter nearly painful to his ears .`` He wasn't the least bit disturbed by my watching him '' , said Charlotte .`` Did you watch him '' ? ?
Asked a red-haired girl named Ceecee Witter .`` I shouldn't have been able to do that '' .`` Well I was able to do it '' , Charlotte said with no sign of irritation .`` For a minute , anyhow .I'm surprised no one has been there .
I've been there a number of times .Sam , I thought you knew everything about Tokyo .You've never been to Ryusenji '' ? ?`` I've heard about it '' , Samuel Burns said .`` There's a little place there called Lovers Mound dedicated to Gompachi and Komurasaki '' .
`` Yes , a little parkish place '' , Charlotte said , and concluded , `` Anyhow , it's all very nice .And the man who brought sweet potatoes into Kanto is buried there , next to a beautiful seated statue of Fudo .Oh , that's what I meant to tell you .This is the interesting part , Richard '' , she had a bothersome habit of trying to pull him into the talking .`` There was that fellow out there in the bitter cold '' --
`` My God , it was cold today '' , said Samuel Burns .`` Twenty-two or twenty-three '' .`` And the water would be still colder '' , Ceecee seemed to shiver at the thought of it .`` And your golden god '' , said Samuel Burns , `` probably went right home and poured himself into a boiling bath .It would kill one of us '' .
`` But the point is '' , Charlotte said , `` there he was , freezing , naked in a little stream of water at Ryusenji , all in worship of Fudo , the god of fire '' .Richard's dark eyes came up and seemed for the tiniest moment to reflect sharp light .It was true ; ;Fudo , the god of wisdom , was also thought of as the Japanese version of Acala .The conversation went on but Richard stopped listening .
He found himself trying to remember something , but he couldn't decide even the nature of what it was he worked to recall .He had almost given up when he realized that the dropping of his biwa into the icy jowls of the black Pacific was the memory for which he had been searching .Perhaps he sensed some connection between the incident on the freighter and the ascetic at Ryusenji , he was unable to put it together .That night , after leaving Charlotte's apartment , Richard walked about for a time before returning to his room .When he at last did go to his room , he couldn't sleep and instead paced up and down before his little image of Acala , thinking first of Charlotte's tale of the man at Ryusenji , then of his biwa and the invisible Pacific waters .
And the next morning , not sure of why he went , he took the train to Fudomae and walked to Ryusenji .He was surprised by the sharp sensation he experienced as he approached the pool which Charlotte had mentioned .He went through a gate to stand at the edge of the water and gazed at the two thin falls which dropped from large spigots high at the back of the pool .On the hillside above was caged what might have been an incarnation of Fudo , or perhaps a demon .The strange creature , housed in wire , made him shudder .
The sensation he so overwhelmingly realized was one which told him he had been there before but he knew he had not , and could not recall any place he had visited to be likened to the limpid green water or the little fountain-falls or the green demon imprisoned beyond his reach .He left the pool and climbed the steep stone stairs to the temple , and the sense of familiarity with the place would not leave him .Into a little well before the temple he dropped a hundred-yen coin and then he had an urge to sound the bell before the temple , to take hold of the rope and crash it against the circle of bronze ; ;but the spirit he wished to call out would not , he knew , come in the person of the temple priest .Instead , he walked around the temple and mounted still another flight of stairs and stood before the seated Fudo at their head .
The black Fudo seemed to stare rigidly back at him and Richard's eyes were caught by the Fudo's in fascination , and then Richard was shocked as , all at once , flames shot out from the sharp features of Fudo's face and there was a terrible metallic scraping sound , as if the large statue were about to burst from some pressure within it .Then the flames were gone , the stillness fell upon the severe black face and Richard began to tremble violently .Suddenly he emptied his pockets of all his coins and dropped them into the box before the seated Fudo and hurried back down both stairways and away from the temple , never looking back .He walked all the miles back to his room .He seemed to have picked up a virus that day , because the next morning he had a small cough and felt a bit hot .
He stayed home , reading and refusing to think about his frightening experience at Ryusenji .But the process of refusing to think about it was an active reminder in itself and he couldn't rid himself of a consciousness of it throughout the day .The cold lingered , making sleep difficult that night , and he remained in bed still the next morning , now unable to keep from thinking about the inexplicable sight of burning metal , the wretched sound , the unbearable feeling of having been to a remote Tokyo temple at some earlier time in his life .All of the elements of the experience were impossible and yet the reality of them was heavy upon him and he resolved never again to visit the temple at Fudomae .I was thinking of the heat and of water that morning when I was plowing the stubble field far across the hill from the farm buildings .
It had grown hot early that day , and I hoped that the boy , my brother's son , would soon come across the broad black area of plowed ground , carrying the jar of cool water .The boy usually was sent out at about that time with the water , and he always dragged an old snow-fence lath or a stick along , to play with .He pretended that the lath was a tractor and he would drag it through the dirt and make buzzing , tractor sounds with his lips .I almost ran over the snake before I could stop the tractor in time .I had turned at the corner of the field and I had to look back to raise the plow and then to drop it again into the earth , and I was thinking of the boy and the water anyway , and when I looked again down the furrow , the snake was there .
It lay half in the furrow and half out , and the front wheels had rolled nearly up to it when I put in the clutch .The tractor was heavily loaded with the weight of the plow turning the earth , and the tractor stopped instantly .The snake slid slowly and with great care from the new ridge the plow had made , into the furrow and did not go any further .I had never liked snakes much , I still had that kind of quick panic that I'd had as a child whenever I saw one , but this snake was clean and bright and very beautiful .He was multi-colored and graceful and he lay in the furrow and moved his arched and tapered head only so slightly .
Go out of the furrow , snake , I said , but it did not move at all .I pulled the throttle of the tractor in and out , hoping to frighten him with the noise , but the snake only flicked its black , forked tongue and faced the huge tractor wheel , without fright or concern .I let the engine idle then , and I got down and went around the wheel and stood beside it .My movement did frighten the snake and it raised its head and trailed delicately a couple of feet and stopped again , and its tongue was working very rapidly .I followed it , looking at the brilliant colors on its tubular back , the colors clear and sharp and perfect , in orange and green and brown diamonds the size of a baby's fist down its back , and the diamonds were set one within the other and interlaced with glistening jet-black .
The colors were astonishing , clear and bright , and it was as if the body held a fire of its own , and the colors came through that transparent flesh and skin , vivid and alive and warm .The eyes were clear and black and the slender body was arched slightly .His flat and gracefully tapered head lifted as I looked at him and the black tongue slipped in and out of that solemn mouth .You beauty , I said , I couldn't kill you .You are much too beautiful .
I had killed snakes before , when I was younger , but there had been no animal like this one , and I knew it was unthinkable that an animal such as that should die .I picked him up , and the length of him arched very carefully and gracefully and only a little wildly , and I could feel the coolness of that radiant , fire-colored body , like splendid ice , and I knew that he had eaten only recently because there were two whole and solid little lumps in the forepart of him , like fieldmice swallowed whole might make .The body caressed through my hands like cool satin , and my hands , usually tanned and dark , were pale beside it , and I asked it where the fire colors could come from the coolness of that body .I lowered him so he would not fall and his body slid out onto the cool , newly-plowed earth , from between my pale hands .The snake worked away very slowly and delicately and with a gorgeous kind of dignity and beauty , and he carried his head a little above the rolled clods .
The sharp , burning colors of his body stood brilliant and plain against the black soil , like a target .I felt good and satisfied , looking at the snake .It shone in its bright diamond color against the sun-burned stubble and the crumbled black clods of soil and against the paleness of myself .The color and beauty of it were strange and wonderful and somehow alien , too , in that dry and dusty and uncolored field .I got on the tractor again and I had to watch the plow closely because the field was drawn across the long hillside and even in that good soil there was a danger of rocks .
I had my back to the corner of the triangular field that pointed towards the house .The earth was a little heavy and I had to stop once and clean the plowshares because they were not scouring properly , and I did not look back towards the place until I had turned the corner and was plowing across the upper line of the large field , a long way from where I had stopped because of the snake .I saw it all at a glance .The boy was there at the lower corner of the field , and he was in the plowed earth , stamping with ferocity and a kind of frenzied impatience .Even at that distance , with no sound but the sound of the tractor , I could tell the fierce mark of brutality on the boy .
I could see the hunched-up shoulders , the savage determination , the dance of his feet as he ground the snake with his heels , and the pirouette of his arms as he whipped at it with the stick .Stop it , I shouted , but the lumbering and mighty tractor roared on , above anything I could say .I stopped the tractor and I shouted down to the boy , and I knew he could hear me , for the morning was clear and still , but he did not even hesitate in that brutal , murdering dance .It was no use .I felt myself tremble , thinking of the diamond light of that beauty I had held a few moments before , and I wanted to run down there and halt , if I could , that frenetic pirouette , catch the boy in the moment of his savagery , and save a glimmer , a remnant , of that which I remembered , but I knew it was already too late .
I drove the tractor on , not looking down there ; ;I was afraid to look for fear the evil might still be going on .My head began to ache , and the fumes of the tractor began to bother my eyes , and I hated the job suddenly , and I thought , there are only moments when one sees beautiful things , and these are soon crushed , or they vanish .I felt the anger mount within me .The boy waited at the corner , with the jar of water held up to me in his hands , and the water had grown bubbly in the heat of the morning .
I knew the boy well .He was eleven and we had done many things together .He was a beautiful boy , really , with finely-spun blonde hair and a smooth and still effeminate face , and his eyelashes were long and dark and brushlike , and his eyes were blue .He waited there and he smiled as the tractor came up , as he would smile on any other day .He was my nephew , my brother's son , handsome and warm and newly-scrubbed , with happiness upon his face and his face resembled my brother's and mine as well .
I saw then , too , the stake driven straight and hard into the plowed soil , through something there where I had been not long before .I stopped the tractor and climbed down and the boy came eagerly up to me .`` Can I ride around with you '' ? ?He asked , as he often did , and I had as often let him be on the tractor beside me .I looked closely at his eyes , and he was already innocent ; ;
the killing was already forgotten in that clear mind of his .`` No , you cannot '' , I said , pushing aside the water jar he offered to me .I pointed to the splintered , upright stake .`` Did you do that '' ? ?I asked .
`` Yes '' , he said , eagerly , beginning a kind of dance of excitement .`` I killed a snake ; ;it was a big one '' .He tried to take my hand to show me .`` Why did you kill it '' ? ?
`` Snakes are ugly and bad '' .`` This snake was very beautiful .Didn't you see how beautiful it was '' ? ?`` Snakes are ugly '' , he said again .`` You saw the colors of it , didn't you ? ?
Have you ever seen anything like it around here '' ? ?`` Snakes are ugly and bad , and it might have bitten somebody , and they would have died '' .`` You know there are no poisonous snakes in this area .This snake could not harm anything '' .`` They eat chickens sometimes '' , the boy said .
`` They are ugly and they eat chickens and I hate snakes '' .`` You are talking foolishly '' , I said .`` You killed it because you wanted to kill it , for no other reason '' .`` They're ugly and I hate them '' , the boy insisted .`` Nobody likes snakes '' .
`` It was beautiful '' , I said , half to myself .The boy skipped along beside me , and he was contented with what he had done .The fire of the colors was gone ; ;there was a contorted ugliness now ; ;the colors of its back were dull and gray-looking , torn and smashed in , and dirty from the boy's shoes .
The beautifully-tapered head , so delicate and so cool , had been flattened as if in a vise , and the forked tongue splayed out of the twisted , torn mouth .The snake was hideous , and I remembered , even then , the cool , bright fire of it only a little while before , and I thought perhaps the boy had always seen it dead and hideous like that , and had not even stopped to see the beauty of it in its life .I wrenched the stake out , that the boy had driven through it in the thickest part of its body , between the colored diamond crystals .I touched it and the coolness , the ice-feeling , was gone , and even then it moved a little , perhaps a tiny spasm of the dead muscles , and I hoped that it was truly dead , so that I would not have to kill it .And then it moved a little more , and I knew the snake was dying , and I would have to kill it there .
The boy stood off a few feet and he had the stake again and he was racing innocently in circles , making the buzzing tractor sound with his lips .I'm sorry , I thought to the snake , for you were beautiful .I took the broken length of it around the tractor and I took one of the wrenches from the tool-kit and I struck its head , not looking at it , to kill it at last , for it could never live .The boy came around behind me , dragging the stake .`` It's a big snake , isn't it '' ? ?
He said .`` I'm going to tell everybody how big a snake I killed '' .`` Don't you see what you have done '' ? ?I said .`` Don't you see the difference now '' ? ?
`` It's an ugly , terrible snake '' , he said .He came up and was going to push at it with his heavy shoes .I could see the happiness in the boy's eyes , the gleeful brutality .`` Don't '' , I said .I could have slapped the boy .
He looked up at me , puzzled , and he swayed his head from side to side .I thought , you little brute , you nasty , selfish , little beast , with brutality already developed within that brain and in those eyes .I wanted to slap his face , to wipe forever the insolence and brutal glee from his mouth , and I decided then , very suddenly , what I would do .Cady didn't come unglued easily , but this had not been a day of glad tidings .Tax worries , production worries , personnel worries , and the letter from Hanford College , his own alma mater , a real snapper .
Hanford realized he had enrolled his son four years ago .Yes , the boy's credentials were in order -- scholastic transcript , character references , picture , health record , successful college boards .But due to the many applicants on file , would he co-operate and write a personal letter giving them his son's motivation , interests and his qualifications for leadership ? ?Cady Partlow lit his pipe with no comfort .This was it .
This was the letter which would or would not enroll his son , David , in Hanford .His son who had never held an office in any organization in the eighteen years of his life .His son who did not know whether he wanted to be doctor , lawyer , merchant or chief .He wondered if he had played it wrong .Maybe he should have kept in touch .
Gone back for reunions .But he had been busy building a business , being a big man in his own town just as he had been a big man at Hanford , Class of 1935 .Besides , Cady Partlow knew he wasn't the old-grad-type .It wouldn't help anyway .Look at Pete Alcorn , who hadn't missed a Hanford ball game in fifteen years .
Pete's son was rejected .Hanford College , Little Ivy League , had no room for football players with low grades .Cady looked at his own son's scholastic record with pride .Good solid B average with a sprinkling of A's in math and science .Imagine his son being that good in science ! !
Mr. Partlow could still feel a cold sweat on his slightly gray temples as he remembered what a near thing chemistry had been for him at Hanford .But then , he hadn't studied very hard .Getting elected president of the student body took a lot of time and politicking .He put down his pipe and started to type .`` In response to your letter , I can in good conscience recommend my son , David , in the field of leadership '' .
He stopped and looked at the picture of his son , the picture on his desk which had changed with the years from a laughing baby to a candidate for Hanford College .He didn't have to be told his son looked like him .David had the same gray eyes , high cheekbones , dark hair and a certain rugged ugliness .Height , 6' .Weight , 160 .
Health , excellent .He turned back to the typewriter with a little more confidence .`` His interests range from astronomy and geology to electronics , tennis and swimming .His chief motivation for enrolling at Hanford is the desire to '' --Mr. Partlow banged his fist on the keyboard , ruining the letter .
He paced to the window and looked at the city he had helped to build .How do you tell a college president that your son doesn't know what he wants to do ? ?That you have refused to drive him into the family business or push him into a profession so you can say at the club , `` Of course David has known since he was twelve he wanted to be an engineer '' -- or a lawyer , or an editor ? ?How do you tell a college like Hanford that your son has a vast potential , that he will find himself ? ?Just give him time , give him a chance .
Cady snapped the Venetian blind shut and slammed himself down before the typewriter , rolled in a fresh sheet , and gave his letter the same savage attention he bestowed on a salesman who needed to have the bucket taken off his thick head .What a production to make of a letter commending your own son ! !His eyebrow went up in amusement at his soul-searching panic .He told Hanford his son wanted to go into the field of electronics .He told Hanford his son had participated in numerous high-school activities .
He belonged to a social club , a civic group , little theater , swimming team , and had been president of the student forum as well as treasurer of the science club .He finished with a flurry of good wishes to Hanford College and signed the letter .There , that did it .Then he met the grave eyes of his wife , Anne , from the photograph next to David's .He shoved the unsealed letter into his coat pocket .
Better show it to Anne and see if he had omitted anything .After all , his wife had written most of his letters for him in those first lean days of Partlow Products .Anne had a way with words .Half of it was natural , half was Smith College .Yet the whole of Anne was something she had never learned in any college .
A woman had it or she didn't .Anne had it .She said what she meant and let it be .She never got on his back .He could take the advice or leave it .
He whistled as he locked the office and grinned as he got on the elevator .`` You look like you just heard a real gasser , Mr. Partlow '' .Cady looked at Tom , who had taken him up and down for fifteen years .`` I was just thinking how things have changed .When I went to college they begged you to come .
Be our guest ! !It's our pleasure ! !Now you have to be well rounded , firm in motivation and pre-packed with knowledge '' ! !Tom slid open the door to the lobby .`` That's a fact , Mr. Partlow .
My John applied to six colleges before he got in '' .`` Going to State '' ? ?`` No .He's president of the rocket club here , you know .Always messing around with science stuff .
Real bright along those lines , you might say .He got a science scholarship to Yale '' .`` Oh '' , said Mr. Partlow , `` that's fine , Tom .Just fine '' .As he drove home through the thinning traffic , Cady felt the unease growing .
He hadn't told anyone , but he , too , had applied to five colleges for David .They had all turned down his son .Weakness in leadership .So sorry .Limited interests .
So sorry .No clear motivation .So sorry .He suddenly realized when he walked into his own pretty darned expensive house that he needed the Martini Anne had waiting for him .But tonight his drink tasted like branch water and even his favorite meal of steak and tossed salad gave no surcease from the growing weight of the letter in his pocket .
Nor did looking at Anne ease the tension as it usually did .He liked looking at Anne .Most people did .He liked her blond hair and the sprinkle of freckles across her nose .From those navy-blue eyes she saw things as clearly and honestly as David did .
She always could sense the shag end of a woolly day .`` Board meeting tonight , Cady '' ? ?`` No , I begged off .Work to do '' .`` Can I have the car , Dad '' ? ?
`` Why not let him take it , Cady ? ?I know it is midweek , but it's only eight days before commencement .Let's forget the rules '' .Cady , deep in thought , neither heard nor answered .David grinned .
Carefully he put down his steak knife and said loudly , `` Mr. Chairman '' ! !Cady Partlow's head came up like that of the proverbial fire horse .`` I'm sorry , Dave .The car ? ?Of course you can have it '' .
Dave ate two pieces of pie as he did everything else , slowly , methodically and with interest .`` Hear anything from Hanford yet , Dad '' ? ?Cady begged the question .`` Don't worry about it , Dave .Your acceptance will come through '' .
Dave shrugged on his sports coat and picked up the car keys .`` Don't be too sure , Dad .Charles Burke got turned down by Dartmouth and he is a straight-A student '' .Anne said it wasn't surprising because Charles was antisocial , a lone wolf , and completely one-sided .`` I can hardly say the same about you , Dave '' ! !
Dave kissed her lightly .`` Girls , my dear parent , are here to stay ! !Get my old man to bed early .He looks a little bit frayed '' .Anne waited until the door had slammed and picked up the coffeepot .
`` Let's go into the library .You do seem somewhat tattered '' .Cady trailed her with the coffee cups and settled into his favorite chair in the comfortable book-lined room .`` I didn't know I looked so dilapidated '' ! !`` Wrong word , darling .
Your fur has been rubbed the wrong way and you show it .Need any help '' ? ?`` In a way , yes .Hanford College hasn't decided on Dave's application yet .They want a letter from me on his motives , interests and leadership .
Here's what I wrote '' .Cady handed her the letter , drank his coffee and waited with what he suddenly realized was belligerence .Already he could feel Anne's questioning eyes .`` I know you wrote this in a hurry , but , Cady , Dave was only acting president of the student forum for a few days .That was when half the school was down with flu '' .
`` But he was president '' .`` And he wasn't really elected treasurer of the science club .He just took over the week Bill Daley was in the state basketball play-off '' .Cady stuck his jaw out .`` The fact remains he was treasurer '' .
`` And the swimming team .No , Cady , he made second team .Just missed the first '' .`` A team is a team '' , insisted Cady .`` Anything else '' ? ?
`` Yes '' , she said quietly .`` I don't think you've been quite honest , Cady .It isn't like you .David's interests .Astronomy .
He was mad about stars at the age of nine .Geology , You and Dave used his rock collection for the bottom of the fishpond six years ago ! !Those aren't his interests now '' .`` What do you suggest '' ? ?`` Just say he likes swimming , tennis , chess and music '' .
`` Music ! !He hasn't been to a symphony concert all season '' .Anne smiled .`` But he plays bass with Chief Crazy Horse and his Five Colts '' ! !`` You mean that rock-and-roll combo ? ?
Even in that he never solos like Jack on guitar or Rich on sax .He's -- he's just there , that's all '' .`` Yes , he's just there .He keeps the beat going .He likes to play bass because he doesn't have to solo .
He doesn't like to rise and shine .Don't worry , Cady , he'll be back in the Beethoven fold by next year '' .Cady appeared slightly mollified .`` All right .But I refuse to be brutally honest and mention Chief Crazy Horse and his Five Colts '' .
Anne laughed and Cady felt the tension loosen its grip on the back of his neck .`` Maybe I am padding it a bit , Anne '' , he said .`` But you know how hard it is to get a boy into a good college .He has to have leadership as well as grades '' .Anne folded the worrisome document .
`` Did you know he is advertising his ham-radio equipment for sale this weekend ? ?He hasn't used it now for several years .Can you really say his motivation for college is electronics '' ? ?Cady felt the jolt as though he had stepped off the curb on his heel .`` And what would you say he wants to do ? ?
Just what '' ? ?`` It's Dave who is applying to Hanford College .Why don't you ask him '' ? ?For once Cady Partlow wished Anne would yell at him so he could yell back .`` I have talked to him , but you know I've never tried to push him into any profession .
I won't be guilty of trying to run his life '' .Anne picked up the towel she was hemming for the hospital guild .`` Just because your father tried to make a banker out of you , you've leaned over backward to keep your hands off .But subconsciously you've wanted him to conform to your mold .You want him to be a leader of men , like you '' .
Cady put the well-worn chip back on his shoulder .`` Dave has qualities of leadership .He just hasn't developed them yet .Give him time '' .He never will , Cady .
Not the kind of leadership you mean , working with lots of people .All your wishful thinking won't change that .Remember what you used to say in the Army ? ?You can't run a war with ninety-nine generals and one private '' ! !Cady walked the block to the mailbox , almost ashamed of himself for arguing with Anne .
Martin felt it was incredible that the situation had come to exist at all .And once begun , had grown to such monstrous proportions .The pair of white cotton shorts ruled his life .Lying awake at night , he could see them , laid out on the floor of his mind .When he rose in the morning , the image was still there .
He had always been a messy and negligent man .In his bachelor days , his bedroom had been strewn with clothes which his mother , or later the hotel maid , generally saw fit to put in order .No doubt Dolores resented following in their footsteps .But it was fun those first days , kidding about the trail of garments he left littered across the rug .There was an assertive maleness in his grinning refusal to pick them up .
Half slyly he enjoyed seeing her stoop to lift the things .He remembered the first time he saw her , standing across the room at a party .The smooth curve of her neck , very white against hair which curled against it like petals .Her hair was the color of those blooms which in seed catalogues are referred to as `` black '' , but since no flower is actually without color contain always a hint of grape or purple or blue -- he wanted to draw the broad patina of hair through his fingers , searching it slowly for a trace of veining which might reveal its true shade beneath the darkness .So he sought her out , and spoke to her , and thought of his hand in her hair .
Or against her back , pressed on the column of vertebrae , which held her so magnificently straight and unyielding , until the segments of bone made tiny sharp cracking noises , like the snapped stem of a tulip .But , to put it bluntly , nothing snapped .Yet that had not seriously troubled him , not then .They married .More he could take at leisure .
All Martin thought he needed was time : to what better use could time be put ? ?He saw later that they had made their marriage too quickly .There was too little occasion beforehand for resistance , the brave strong delights of emotional clash and meeting .They had left themselves too much to discover .But , at the start , his new life felt invigorating .
Good .It was on the tenth day after the wedding ( how could it have been so soon ? ?) that he dropped the shorts on the floor .`` Now , I'm not going to pick up those shorts '' ! !Martin gave her a teasing pat .
`` I think you'll get tired of them there '' .In the morning the shorts were where he had left them .He smiled to himself , and decided not to mention them till Dolores did .It was almost too easy .For he had just remembered : tonight they were having their first guests .
The shorts would not be on the floor when he came home that evening .He was wrong .The rest of the bedroom had been groomed to a superhuman neatness , but in the middle of the carpet lay the disheveled shorts .They gave the room a strange note of incongruity , like a mole on a beautiful face .He saw that Dolores intended to wait until the last minute , thinking he would get nervous .
Quietly he determined to foil her .I can be as stubborn as she can , he thought ; ;my nerves are as strong .She'll rush to the bedroom when the doorbell rings .It rang .
Ten minutes early .Martin was standing a few feet from the front door .He swung around , eyes toward the bedroom , some fifteen feet away .Dolores stood motionless in the doorway .He could not cross the living room , brush past her , and bend down to retrieve the shorts .
Martin turned his back .He strode to answer the bell .Bill's hat was deposited in the hall closet .With the most casual and relaxed manner in the world , Dolores led Anthea to the bedroom .Martin strained his ears .
At first he could not be sure .Then he caught just enough to know that the shorts were still there .A glissade of giggles slid over their voices .All evening Anthea favored him with odd , coy looks .Clearly she had been instructed `` not to say a word '' .
For some reason , this ellipsis in the conversation spread until it swallowed up every other topic .At last there was a void no one could fill .The Brainards went home early .Martin realized , later on , that he should have `` had it out '' with Dolores that night .As violently as possible .
But he was so taken aback , he could not believe any rage of his would make her give in .On the contrary , it would only weaken his position if he fumed , while she stayed calm and adamant .And if he surrendered after raving at her .He shivered .Suppose he ran up the white flag altogether ? ?
At once .He considered the sober possibility .In his head was the echo of those titters with Anthea .There was something about private feminine whisperings which always made him feel scabrous and unclean .He remembered his mother gossiping with her neighborhood women friends , lowering her voice to a penetrating hoarseness which might be trusted to carry to the head of the stairs , where he crouched listening .
He could even recall the last time he sat there .She was talking about him that time , because he had done some bad thing , something she disliked , but `` Afterwards Martin said he was sorry .He apologized so sweetly , I couldn't keep being annoyed with him '' .It wasn't even true that he'd said he was sorry that time ; ;he had in fact said simply that he wished the thing hadn't happened , which was as honest as he could put it .
But his mother told the story over and over , till her `` Martin said he was sorry '' was as much a part of her as the shape of her thin , pallid ears .The battle had to be fought .Let the best sex win .But his resolution hardly seemed to help .If the situation had been bad , it now got worse .
About this time people began `` dropping in '' , considering that the newly married had been left alone long enough .Angrily Martin wished they had delayed the wedding and gone on a trip -- preferably one that lasted months -- instead of deciding not to postpone the date until he could get away .Here they were at the mercy of anyone who chose to come by .These stray people nearly always insisted on Dolores showing them around the apartment .Of course , the tours of inspection included the ever-present shorts .
It was curious how the different visitors took this .Some tried to ignore the blot on the bedroom's countenance .Others asked .Quite a few laughed .To them all Dolores told a lighthearted and witty tale .
`` It's a little contest Martin and I have '' , she would begin gaily , carrying the anecdote through a frothy and deceptive course .While he waited in the living room .Once Martin went along .They entered the bedroom , and Dolores said nothing .Then one of the guests showed his merriment .
`` You were in a hurry , weren't you '' ? ?Martin would have liked to break the man's neck .Dolores smiled ; ;she let the interpretation stand .Now Martin heard himself give a snort of mock good nature .
With her eyes Dolores dared him for the truth , ready to begin : It's a little contest --Never again did he enter into the ritual of showing the apartment .They kept up a rigid pretense of speaking relations .But Martin seldom felt the impulse to talk about anything .What to talk about ? ?
Dolores kept picking up any of his clothes ( except the fatal shorts ) which he left about , but he had been robbed of pleasure in scattering his possessions .He fell into the habit of putting his clothes in drawers and closets , so his life might impinge as little as possible on hers .The shorts alone remained .In his moments of worst agony , Martin imagined what his friends were saying .The sound of their amazement .
Bizarre : He could hear the word .The most bizarre situation .We were up to visit them andHe had thought her exactly what he wanted .Six weeks of marriage and I'm using the past tense , he told himself furiously .
Pursuing his idea , he saw that it would be impossible to leave her now .Everyone would know why ; ;he would cut a supremely ridiculous figure .He was trapped .Day and night Martin could not drag his mind from the dilemma he had made for himself .
His mind scurried frantically , seeking an exit .Alternately he had periods of hostile defeatism in which he determined sullenly , morosely , to live out his life in this fashion .Nothing would change , nothing would ever change .When the solution finally came to him , one night while he was in bed , he was so shaken by its simplicity that he could only wonder why it had not occurred to him before .In a frenzy of excitement , he considered his plan .
Beside his shorts , he would place something of hers .Instantaneously he would have won an immeasurable moral victory , for if she picked up , say , a pair of her panties , she might just as well lift his shorts lying alongside -- the expenditure of energy was almost the same .He felt that it would be a particular humiliation to Dolores to pick up her own underwear which he had laid on the floor .Furthermore , he could go on repeating the maneuver endlessly : every time he went in the bedroom , he could drop a slip or a brassiere , or maybe a girdle , next to his shorts .Sooner or later , Dolores would crack .
On the other hand , if she didn't remove her own things , it would be difficult to explain to the parade of guests which traversed the apartment .Martin guessed that Dolores would not be so eager to tell the next installment of her story .The tale , he thought , would become less gay .She had used his rumpled shorts as the very image of his childishness , his lack of control , his general male looseness , while she remained cool , airy , and untouched , the charming teacher who disciplined an unruly body .To have her underclothes linked with his on the floor would draw her visibly into a struggle both bitter and absurd .
Something in the back of his mind was aware that the magnificence of the plan lay in his faith , that the idea would work because he believed in it , since his courage and virility were involved , because it was truly his .The knowledge kept him from analyzing his scheme to death , and took him through the last hours of that night in a peace of exalted fanaticism .The next morning , while Dolores was out of the room , he went to her bureau drawer , took out a pair of nylon lace pants , and tenderly dropped them next to his shorts .He sat down on the bed .In a surprisingly short time , Dolores appeared .
To his delight , her eyes focused at once upon the two garments .Slowly and deliberately she reached down and touched the lace with her fingers , then hesitated for about a second .Ah , he thought , she's going through the chain of reasoning which says she might really just as well pick up my shorts too .He saw that in a moment she had grasped all the implications of a plot which had been weeks in occurring to him .Extending her fingers another inch , she caught up the shorts , and swiftly left the room .
She did not look at him , but he noticed that her face was flushed and her eyes unsteady .They breakfasted together , but Martin did not refer to his triumph , and Dolores found a great deal to do in the kitchen , bobbing up and down from the table so that talk was impossible .Well , Martin thought , That'll save .He left for work in high spirits .As he relaxed that day , Martin realized how tense he had been these past weeks .
He found that he no longer hated Dolores ( he knew how much he had hated her ) , and he was surprised at a resurgence of an affectionate feeling .`` Good old A-Z '' , Cap said .`` You know , I've got one of your cars at home .As a prominent industrialist , you ought to be interested in his nibs' support group .Isn't his racket down your alley '' ? ?
Once it was , William thought .But not any more .A rush of memory swept him back , and he forgot Cap .How did he start on such a ride to brief glory ? ?Simply enough , through the inadvertent agency of his brother-in-law .
General Hershey's draft and Doc Eddyman and Cap were responsible for his first eminence , but Fearless Freddy Bryan could take credit , if he cared to ( and he did ) , for the second time .Freddy needed a job , having been detached from a rather dangerous career in real estate and skyscraper financing by Gerry , and it was up to Arthur Willis to provide him with one .Mr. Willis bought Zenith Plastic Products , a skeleton corporation of sorts which had undergone many vicissitudes and whose principal assets were a couple of electronics plants on Long Island engaged in working out government contracts , and installed Freddy in an executive position .Shortly after , Freddy had his usual proliferation of bold ideas .Willis listened patiently , and once in a while William was exposed to them at a family gathering ; ;
he generally heard Freddy's suggestions without interest , being absorbed by his own prospering concerns .Probably Mr. Willis was influenced toward deeper involvement by familial loyalty and a concern for his grandchildren .Gerry began to aid Freddy with her father , prodded , no doubt , by Joan's open contempt for Freddy and William's irritating competency .Another factor must have been the eventual disposal of Willis' fortune ; ;she unquestionably assumed that the more he was entwined with Freddy , the more likely he was to reward Freddy richly upon his death .
Whatever the reasons , Willis and Bryan started expanding Zenith .They acquired another electronics factory , a specialized ceramics company , an organization that built -- very experimentally -- high-speed research calculators .Since they were hunting for national defense contracts , Adam Herberet , a man of surprising resources , entered the combination as a silent partner because of his political connections .Feeling his power , Freddy looked for additional worlds to conquer .Heavy industry , slanted toward inexhaustible government coffers , attracted him .
The Allstates Auto Company , a medium-sized firm which manufactured four-wheel-drive vehicles and other off-road equipment , had recently constructed an over-large , modern plant in a burst of misguided optimism .Cursed with a shaky management and dissatisfied stockholders , it was ripe for amalgamation , and Freddy's instinct was to keep growing by stock mergers and small expenditure of cash , and never mind inevitable consequences .With Herberet's blessing , he was convinced that Allstates' Wisconsin folly would be ideal for conversion to airplane sub-assembly , tanks , missiles or ordnance of some kind .At that point William came into the picture .Although not much desiring the account , he had been appointed advertising head of Zenith .
Freed of routine by having his own firm and a complaisant partner , his work in New York had given him a broader overall knowledge of business administration and corporate structure ; ;and if he wasn't entirely committed to what he did , he was at least fascinated by the chance of wider opportunities .Mr. Willis , eager to have him allied with the family , wanted advice beyond the confines of his field , and William set out on a serious study of the situation , including trips to Wisconsin and Washington .In the end , he said : `` I'm not enchanted by the proposition , sir .I know a guy named Jack Hamrick , a very bright young engineer who was with Chrysler , and I took him with me to Allstates .
It's his expert opinion that the plant isn't well suited to what you have in mind .The conversion will cost a fortune .Besides that , I'm acquainted more or less with the defense hardware situation through my contacts in the Air Force .I think Adam Herberet is guilty of being too hopeful and better informed on defense financing than on the technical side .Missiles have thrown everything up for grabs , and nobody seems to be sure where we go from here .
The future of manned aircraft is in doubt , which affects government procurement , and jet transports have revolutionized the airline trade -- one jet can take the place of three compound-engine planes .This means the aircraft companies are going to tear into the government market , looking for anything they can get and making the competition tough .Here are a few facts and figures I've assembled .Can't you stay with what you have and wait till the dust settles '' ? ?Willis glanced at the bound pages given him and shrugged .
`` Well '' , he said , `` there is Freddy , you know .And Gerry .Freddy is deeply committed to our plans already .He assures me he has people to handle the money raising , and Ham Richert , my lawyer , says the legal aspects of the wedding of Zenith and Allstates are no problem .I don't like to exhibit the deadly dampening effect of an elderly man's caution '' .
`` Yes , I appreciate that .I wish you wouldn't tell Freddy I'm lukewarm ; ;I've caused him trouble before , and he's beginning to resent me .If we don't take care , the sisters will be entering the fray on opposite sides , brandishing their cudgels '' .`` Which is a frightful prospect , Bill '' .
