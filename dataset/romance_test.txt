allied to them was Gerry , devoting much time to swaying her father , and Joan dismissed all thought of the project and William was unwilling to interfere further .Zenith absorbed Allstates , stock transfers were arranged , and Freddy became president of the hyphenated combination .
Through Jack Hamrick , William fell into the world of automobile promotion and got several accounts for Shoals and Clay .He forgot about A-Z till , unhappily , he and Hamrick were proved correct .
Freddy's backing dropped away from him and Mr. Willis was forced to make up the deficit .Adam , beset by changing defense conditions and the open secret that he was part of the new corporation , couldn't deliver from his end .
The Wisconsin plant turned out to be a white elephant .Stock Willis held in abundance fell sharply in value .
Confronted by a grim future , Freddy lost his nerve and plumped for a drastic liquidation .Once more Willis summoned William .
`` You were right '' , he said -- `` you and your engineer -- and I'm in something of a bind .Freddy's solution doesn't appeal to me .
In addition to other defects , I'm a stubborn man and hate to admit to the common garden variety of bad judgment .Will you see if you can help me '' ? ?
William spent a long week end closeted with Hamrick .His recent experience in motor car advertising , a love for cars of themselves , the existence of A-Z's useless Wisconsin set-up , exposure to exciting conceptions of Hamrick's that nobody would buy , and the coincidental recent failure of a respected but out-dated small-car manufacturer called Ticonderoga Motors had given him an idea of such dimensions he was almost afraid to broach it .
Initially , Hamrick's reaction to A-Z going into the passenger car market was discouraging .He thought the financing , the advertising , the production of new models , the founding of a nationwide chain of dealerships was simply too difficult .
Then he caught fire .If A-Z could buy Ticonderoga cheaply and use their presses and dies and other equipment , if William could hit precisely the right promotion note , if the money hurdle was not insurmountable .
They took nearly a month to investigate , marshal statistics , and put their arguments down in black and white .Taking Hamrick with him , William went to Mr. Willis .
He was surprised and dubious , but impressed by the engineer and the report .`` Your alternative is breathtaking '' , he said , `` and , I'm frank in saying , a bit mad .
I wish I was younger and less timid .Well , I can't resolve this myself .
I'll have to call in the brain trust .Are you willing to run the gantlet ? ?
I can't guarantee you a sympathetic audience '' .`` We'll be in there swinging '' , William said , `` but in a way , sir , you've got to decide it yourself .
You have the controlling interest and the principal expenditure is yours -- and , besides , nobody else is going to have the courage .If they follow anyone , it'll have to be you '' .
He paused .`` I should explain : there's more here for me than advocating my little dream , there's you .
You mustn't take a fall , or publicly back away .I hate that .
You're -- you're Arthur Willis .Forgive the hearts and flowers theme '' .
`` I rather like the music '' , Willis replied quietly .`` Thank you '' .
At the meeting , attended by Freddy , Richert , Herberet and the A-Z executive staff , with Mr. Willis presiding , William and Hamrick did indeed run the gantlet .From shock and incredulity , most of the listeners went on to open resistance and animosity .
`` Oh , my God '' , Ham Richert said , `` a little child shall lead them .Move over , General Motors '' .
`` It's absurd , Bill '' , Freddy said , from a pale face .`` You're leading Dad down the garden path '' .
`` Your garden , God damn it '' ! !William said .
`` I don't enjoy family quarrels '' , Adam said .`` Nor crazy relatives .
We're here to transact business .Can't we put an end to this , Arthur '' ? ?
`` Hear me out , please '' , William begged .`` I'm an advertising hustler , I admit , but I have to get hot once in a larger sphere .
Sure , Ticonderoga went broke in the low-priced market bucking the Big Three .Their cars weren't small enough , they didn't have the power , they were old-fashioned .
They tried to sell 'em on economy and simple merit .We've arrived at an age for romance and snobbery .
We've all been rich and spoiled long enough to hate the machine age .Look what those little European jobs are doing .
We'll woo the consumer with a product , not bludgeon him with chromed excess length and weight .Let's make it moonlight and the call of far places and a seduction , at reasonable rates .
Ticonderoga folded a few minutes too soon , before the tide changed , still honest and stupid -- and the network of dealers the company had is around waiting to be signed up again -- waiting for us , ready-made .We've got rid of the steam yachts and Georgian houses , and the bloated , too-expensive automobile is next .
Why not come down smartly in the world , in a chic fashion , with an Allstates-Zenith '' ? ?He swayed them somewhat , but the debate raged on .
Financing emerged as the main obstacle .Mr. Willis made it evident that he had contributed his maximum .
`` Nobody will underwrite it , I'm telling you '' , Freddy said .`` I know what I'm talking about in that department '' .
`` There's plenty of risk money '' , Ham Richert added , `` but not for anything this risky '' .`` All right '' , William said .
`` We'll try to swing the deal on that basis .If we can't raise the capital , we're through .
Nothing has been lost .You're up against it anyhow .
Why won't you give me a chance '' ? ?A silence fell .
Heads instinctively turned in Willis' direction .He smiled at William and slowly rubbed his hands together .
`` I feel I must answer the question '' , he said , `` since the onus later , if any , should fall on me -- I don't relish recriminations spread broadcast outside my family .I'm not giving you a chance , Bill , but availing myself of your generous offer of assistance .
Good luck to you '' .`` All the in-laws have got to have their day '' , Adam said , and glared at William and Freddy in turn .
Sweat started out on William's forehead , whether from relief or disquietude he could not tell .Across the table , Hamrick saluted him jubilantly with an encircled thumb and forefinger .
Nobody else showed pleasure .Spike-haired , burly , red-faced , decked with horn-rimmed glasses and an Ivy League suit , Jack Hamrick awaited William at the officers' club .
`` Hello , boss '' , he said , and grinned .`` I suppose I can never expect to call you ' General ' after that Washington episode '' .
