C'mon , buddy , help me set up the kitchen and we'll have food in a minute or two '' .Cappy looked wary , but he moved off the floorboards and followed the dirty ex-musician to the center of the refuse-littered boxcar .Ernie crouched and opened the carpet bag .
He took out a small packet filled with bits of charcoal , a deep pot of thin metal , some sheets of newspaper , a book of matches and a wrinkled and many-times folded piece of tin foil with holes in it .He put the charcoal in the pot , lit the paper with the matches , and carefully stretched the tin foil across the top of the pot .`` A charcoal pit , man '' , he said , indicating the slightly-smoking makeshift brazier .
`` Fan it '' , he told Cappy , handing him a sheet of newspaper .`` Yeah , but what're we gonna eat ? ?Charcoal '' ? ?
`` Fella '' , Ernie waggled a dirty finger at the younger man , `` you try my ever-lovin' patience '' .He reached once more into the carpet bag and brought up a package of wieners .`` Hot dogs , man .
Not the greatest , but they stick to your belly insides '' .He ripped down the cellophane carefully , and laid three dogs on the tin foil .Almost immediately they began to sizzle .
He looked up and grinned .`` A Kroger's self-serve '' , he explained .`` I self-served '' .
When they had licked the last of the wieners' taste from their fingers , they settled back , and Cappy offered Ernie a cigarette .Nice kid , Ernie thought , too bad .`` How come you're riding the rods , kids like you '' ? ?
Ernie asked .Cappy looked down at his wide hands , and did not reply .But surprisingly , Kitty's face came up and she said , `` My father .
He didn't want us to get married .So we ran away '' .`` Why didn't he want you to get hitched '' ? ?
This time even she did not answer .She looked down at her hands , too .After a few seconds , she said , `` Dad didn't like Cappy .
It was my fault '' .Cappy's head came around sharply .`` Your fault , hell ! !
It was all my fault .If I'd been careful it never woulda '' -- he stopped abruptly .Ernie's eyebrows went up .
`` What's the matter '' ? ?The girl still did not raise her eyes , but she added simply , `` I'm pregnant '' .Cappy raged at himself .
`` Oh he was stupid , her old man ! !You never heard nothin' like it : Kitty's gonna go have an abortion , and Kitty's gonna go away to a convent , and Kitty's this and Kitty's that like he was nuts or somethin' , y'know '' ? ?Ernie nodded .
This was a slightly different matter .He remembered Midge , and the child .But that had been a time before all this , a time he didn't think about .
A time before the white lightning and the bumming had turned him inside out .But these kids weren't like him .Oh crap ! !
He thought , Pull out of it , old son .These are just another couple of characters to roll .What they got , you get .
Now forget all this other .`` Wanna drink '' ? ?Ernie offered , taking the pint of sweet lucy from his jacket pocket .
`` Yeah .Now that you offer '' .The answer came from the open door of the boxcar .
From the man who had leaped in from the high bank outside , as the train had slowed on the grade .Ernie stared at the man .He was big .
Real big , with shoulders out to here , and hair all over him like a grizzly .Road gang , Ernie thought .`` You gonna give me a drink , fella '' ? ?
The big man asked again , taking a step into the boxcar .Ernie hesitated a moment .This character could break him in half .
`` Sure '' , he said , and lifted the pint to his own lips .He guzzled down three-quarters of the strong home-blend and proffered the remainder .The man stalked toward them , his big boots heavy on the wooden flooring .
He took the bottle with undue belligerence , and making sucking noises with his thick lips , drained it completely .He threw his head back , closed his eyes , and belched ferociously .He belched again , and opening his eyes , threw the bottle out the open door .
`` Well , now '' , he said , and reached into his pocket .`` I didn't know I was gonna have company in this car '' .`` We're going to Philadelphia '' , Kitty said , pulling her skirt down around her legs all the more .
`` No , I don't think so '' , said the big man , and it was the final clincher for Ernie .He had suspected this guy was trouble , and now he was sure of it .`` Maybe you and me will , girlie , but these two ain't goin' nowhere '' .
He advanced on them , and abruptly there was a shocked electricity in the car .Ernie was screaming inside himself : No , damn you , you ain't gonna take my meal ticket away from me ! !The newcomer stalked toward them , and Kitty shied back , her hand to her mouth .
Her scream split up the silence of the car , accompanied by the rattling of the freight , and then Cappy came off the floor , his legs driving him hard .The kid hit the bigger man with an audible thwump ! !And carried him backward in a footballer's tackle .
They went down in a heap and for a long minute there was nothing to see but flailing arms and legs .The kid showed for an instant , and his arm was cocked back .The fist went down into the pile of flesh , and Ernie heard the bigger man's deeper voice go , `` Aaawww '' ! !
Then they were tumbling again , and the big man reached into the same pocket he had gone for earlier , and came up with a vicious switchblade .He held the knife aloft an instant -- an instant enough to press the stud .The blade came out with a snick ! !
He fisted the knife overhand , and drew back to plunge it into the kid's throat .Kitty screamed insanely and her face was white .She grabbed at Feathertop's sleeve and shrieked , `` Help him ! !
