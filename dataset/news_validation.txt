In the Notre Dame report , reference was made to the fact that faculty members were reduced to `` luncheon-table communication '' .In itself there is nothing wrong with this form of `` participation '' : the only difficulty on the Catholic campus is that those faculty members who are in a position to implement policy , i.e. , members of the religious community which owns and administers the institution , have their own eating arrangements .Sen. John L. McClellan of Arkansas and Rep. David Martin of Nebraska are again beating the drums to place the unions under the anti-monopoly laws .Once more the fallacious equation is advanced to argue that since business is restricted under the anti-monopoly laws , there must be a corresponding restriction against labor unions : the law must treat everybody equally .Or , in the words of Anatole France , `` The law in its majestic equality must forbid the rich , as well as the poor , from begging in the streets and sleeping under bridges '' .
The public atmosphere that has been generated which makes acceptance of this law a possibility stems from the disrepute into which the labor movement has fallen as a result of Mr. McClellan's hearings into corruption in labor-management relations and , later , into the jurisdictional squabbles that plagued industrial relations at the missile sites .The Senator was shocked by stoppages over allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile program .In addition , disclosures that missile workers were earning sums far in excess of what is paid for equivalent work elsewhere provoked his indignation on behalf of the American taxpayer who was footing the bill .It is now disclosed that the taxpayer not only pays for high wages , but he pays the employers' strike expenses when the latter undertakes to fight a strike .Business Week ( Aug. 9 , 1961 ) reports that the United Aircraft Company , against which the International Association of Machinists had undertaken a strike , decided to keep its plants operating .
The company incurred some $10 million of expenses attributable to four factors : advertising to attract new employees , hiring and training them , extra overtime , and defective work performed by the new workers .The company has billed the United States Government for $7,500,000 of these expenses under the Defense Department regulation allowing costs of a type generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the conduct of the contractor's business .Rep. Frank Kowalski of Connecticut has brought this problem to the attention of the Armed Services Committee .The committee remains unresponsive .Neither has Congressman Martin nor Senator McClellan been heard from on the matter ; ;
they are preoccupied with ending labor abuses by extending the anti-monopoly laws to the unions .The recent publicity attending the successful federal prosecution of a conspiracy indictment against a number of electrical manufacturers has evoked a new respect for the anti-trust laws that is justified neither by their rationale nor by the results they have obtained .The anti-trust laws inform a business that it must compete , but along completely undefined lines ; ;it must play a game in which there never is a winner .The fact is that any business that wants to operate successfully cannot follow the law .
Hypocrisy thus becomes the answer to a foolish public policy .Let us look at the heavy-electrical-goods industry in which General Electric , Westinghouse and a number of other manufacturers were recently convicted of engaging in a conspiracy to rig prices and allocate the market .The industry is so structured that price-setting by a multi-product company will vary with the way overhead charges are allocated -- whether marginal or average pricing is applied .The problem becomes even more complex where an enterprise is engaged in the manufacture of a wide variety of other goods in addition to the heavy electrical equipment .Accounting procedures can be varied to provide a rationale for almost any price .
Naturally , enterprises of the size of General Electric are in a position to structure their prices in such a way that the relatively small competitors can be forced to the wall in a very short time .Should these giants really flex their competitive muscles , they would become the only survivors in the industry .Uncle Sam would then accuse them of creating a monopoly by `` unfair competition '' .But if they show self-restraint , they don't get the orders .Under the circumstances , the only protection for the relatively small manufacturers is to engage in exactly the kind of conspiracy with the giants for which the latter were convicted .
Engaging in such a conspiracy was an act of mercy by the giants .The paradox implicit in the whole affair is shown by the demand of the government , after the conviction , that General Electric sign a wide-open consent decree that it would not reduce prices so low as to compete seriously with its fellows .In other words , the anti-trust laws , designed to reduce prices to the consumer on Monday , Wednesday and Friday , become a tool to protect the marginal manufacturer on Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday .And which theory would govern the enforcers of the law on Sunday ? ?The question might be asked : `` Don't the managements of the heavy-electrical-goods manufacturers know these facts ? ?
Why did they engage in a flood of mea culpas , throw a few scapegoats to the dogs and promise to be good boys thereafter , expressing their complete confidence in the laws '' ? ?The past usefulness of the anti-trust laws to management was explained by Thurman Arnold , in The Folklore of Capitalism , back in 1937 .He wrote : `` ( P. 211 ) the anti-trust laws were the answer of a society which unconsciously felt the need of great organizations , and at the same time had to deny them a place in the moral and logical ideology of the social structure .( P. 214 ) anti-trust laws became the greatest protection to uncontrolled business dictatorship .( P. 215 ) when corporate abuses were attacked , it was done on the theory that criminal penalties would be invoked rather than control .
In this manner , every scheme for direct control broke to pieces on the great protective rock of the anti-trust laws .( Pp. 228-229 ) in any event , it is obvious that the anti-trust laws did not prevent the formation of some of the greatest financial empires the world has ever known , held together by some of the most fantastic ideas , all based on the fundamental notion that a corporation is an individual who can trade and exchange goods without control by the government '' .This escape from control has led to management's evaluating the risk of occasional irrational prosecution as worth while .A plea of nolo contendere , followed by a nominal fine , after all is a small price to pay for this untrammeled license .( The penalties handed out in the electrical case , which included jail sentences , were unprecedented in anti-trust prosecutions , perhaps because the conspirators had displayed unusual ineptness in their pricing activities .
)If a substitute mechanism is needed for the control of a fictitious impersonal market , quite obviously some method must be devised for representing the public interest .A secret conspiracy of manufacturers is hardly such a vehicle .However , one can argue that no such control is necessary as long as one pretends that the anti-trust laws are effective and rational .Quite clearly the anti-trust laws are neither effective nor rational -- and yet the argument goes that they should be extended to the labor union .
Those who favor placing trade unions under anti-trust laws imply that they are advocating a brand new reform .Before 1933 , individuals who opposed trade unions and collective bargaining said so in plain English .The acceptance of collective bargaining as a national policy in 1934 , implicit in the writing of Section 7A of the National Industrial Recovery Act , has made it impolitic to oppose collective bargaining in principle .The Wagner Act , the Taft-Hartley Act and the Landrum-Griffin Act all endorse the principle of collective bargaining .The basic purpose of an effective collective-bargaining system is the removal of wages from competition .
If a union cannot perform this function , then collective bargaining is being palmed off by organizers as a gigantic fraud .The tortured reasoning that unions use to deny their ambition to exercise monopoly power over the supply and price of labor is one of the things that create a legal profession .The problem must be faced squarely .If laborers are merely commodities competing against each other in a market place like so many bags of wheat and corn ( unsupported , by the way , by any agricultural subsidy ) , then they may be pardoned for reacting with complete antagonism to a system that imposes such status upon them .Human labor was exactly that -- a commodity -- in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century America .
As early as 1776 , Adam Smith wrote in The Wealth Of Nations : `` We have no acts of Parliament against combining to lower the price of work ; ;but many against combining to raise it '' .Eighteenth-century England , upon whose customs our common law was built , had outlawed unions as monopolies and conspiracies .In 1825 , the Boston house carpenters' strike for a ten-hour day was denounced by the organized employers , who declared : `` It is considered that all combinations by any classes of citizens intended to effect the value of labor tend to convert all its branches into monopolies '' .There were no pious hypocrisies then about being for collective bargaining , but against labor monopoly .
The courts shared the opinion of the employers .In People vs. Fisher , Justice Savage of the New York Supreme Court declared :`` Without any officious and improper interference on the subject , the price of labor or the wages of mechanics will be regulated by the demand for the manufactured article and the value of that which is paid for it ; ;but the right does not exist to raise the wages of the mechanic by any forced and artificial means '' .Compare this statement of a nineteenth-century judge with how Congressman Martin , according to the Daily Labor Report of Sept. 19 , 1961 , defends the necessity of enacting anti-trust legislation in the field of labor `` if we wish to prevent monopolistic fixing of wages , production or prices and if we wish to preserve the freedom of the employer and his employees to contract on wages , hours and conditions of employment '' .
Senator McClellan is proposing the application of anti-trust measures to unions in transportation .His bill , allegedly aimed at Hoffa , would amend the Sherman , Clayton and Norris-LaGuardia acts to authorize the issuance of federal injunctions in any transportation strike and would make it illegal for any union to act in concert with any other union -- even a sister local in the same international .Paradoxically , the same week in which Senator McClellan was attempting to extend the anti-trust act to labor in transportation , the Civil Aeronautics Board was assuring the airlines that if they met in concert to eliminate many costly features of air travel , the action would not be deemed a violation of the anti-trust act .Indeed , it is in the field of transportation that Congress has most frequently granted employers exemption from the anti-trust laws ; ;for example , the organization of steamship conferences to set freight rates and the encouragement of railroads to seek mergers .
At the very moment that every attempt is being made to take management out from under the irrationality of anti-trust legislation , a drive is on to abolish collective bargaining under the guise of extending the anti-monopoly laws to unions who want no more than to continue to set wages in the same way that ship operators set freight rates .The passage of the Sherman Act was aimed at giant monopolies .It was most effective against trade unions .In the famous Danbury Hatters case , a suit was brought against the union by the Loewe Company for monopolistic practices , e.g. , trying to persuade consumers not to purchase the product of the struck manufacturer .The suit against the union was successful and many workers lost their homes to pay off the judgment .
In 1914 , the Clayton Act attempted to take labor out from under the anti-trust legislation by stating that human labor was not to be considered a commodity .The law could not suspend economics .Labor remained a commodity -- but presumably a privileged one granted immunization from the anti-trust laws .The courts , by interpretation , emasculated the act .In 1922 , the United Mine Workers struck the Coronado Coal Company .
The company sued under the anti-trust laws , alleging that the union's activity interfered with the movement of interstate commerce .( What other purpose could a striking union have but to interrupt the flow of commerce from the struck enterprise ? ?) The court first ruled that the strike constituted only an indirect interference with commerce .The nationthe three-front war
At a closed-door session on Capitol Hill last week , Secretary of State Christian Herter made his final report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on U.S. affairs abroad .Afterward , Tennessee's Democratic Senator Albert Gore summed it up for newsmen .What Herter presented , said Gore , was `` not a very encouraging review '' .That was something of an understatement in a week when the underlying conflict between the West and Communism erupted on three fronts .While Communists were undermining United Nations efforts to rescue the Congo from chaos , two other Communist offensives stirred the Eisenhower Administration into emergency conferences and serious decisions .
1 ) Cuba .Hours after a parade of his new Soviet tanks and artillery , Dictator Fidel Castro suddenly confronted the U.S. with a blunt and drastic demand : within 48 hours , the U.S. had to reduce its embassy and consulate staffs in Cuba to a total of eleven persons ( the embassy staff alone totaled 87 U.S. citizens , plus 120 Cuban employees ) .President Eisenhower held an 8:30 a.m. meeting with top military and foreign-policy advisers , decided to break off diplomatic relations immediately .`` There is a limit to what the United States in self-respect can endure '' , said the President .`` That limit has now been reached '' .
Through Secretary Herter , Ike offered President-elect Kennedy an opportunity to associate his new Administration with the breakoff decision .Kennedy , through Secretary-designate of State Dean Rusk , declined .He thus kept his hands free for any action after Jan. 20 , although reaction to the break was generally favorable in the U.S. and Latin America ( see the hemisphere ) .2 ) Laos .After a White House huddle between the President and top lieutenants , the Defense Department reacted sharply to a cry from the pro-Western government of Laos that several battalions of Communist troops had invaded Laos from North Viet Nam .
`` In view of the present situation in Laos '' , said the Pentagon's announcement , `` we are taking normal precautionary actions to increase the readiness of our forces in the Pacific '' .Cutting short a holiday at Hong Kong , the aircraft carriers Lexington and Bennington steamed off into the South China Sea , accompanied by a swarm of destroyers , plus troopships loaded with marines .On the U.S.'s island base of Okinawa , Task Force 116 , made up of Army , Navy , Marine and Air Force units , got braced to move southward on signal .But by week's end the Laotian cry of invasion was read as an exaggeration ( see foreign news ) , and the U.S. was agreeing with its cautious British and French allies that a neutralist -- rather than a pro-Western -- government might be best for Laos .French & Indians .
There was a moral of sorts in the Laotian situation that said much about all other cold-war fronts .Political , economic and military experts were all agreed that chaotic , mountainous little Laos was the last place in the world to fight a war -- and they were probably right .`` It would be like fighting the French and Indian War all over again '' , said one military man .But why was Laos the new Southeast Asian battleground ? ?At Geneva in 1954 , to get the war in Indo-China settled , the British and French gave in to Russian and Communist Chinese demands and agreed to the setting up of a Communist state , North Viet Nam -- which then , predictably , became a base for Communist operations against neighboring South Viet Nam and Laos .
The late Secretary of State John Foster Dulles considered the 1954 Geneva agreement a specimen of appeasement , saw that resolution would be needed to keep it from becoming a calamity for the West .He began the diplomatic discussions that resulted in the establishment of Aj .`` The important thing from now on '' , he said , `` is not to mourn the past but to seize the future opportunity to prevent the loss in northern Viet Nam from leading to the extension of Communism throughout Southeast Asia '' .Russian tanks and artillery parading through the streets of Havana , Russian intrigue in the Congo , and Russian arms drops in Laos ( using the same Ilyushin transports that were used to carry Communist agents to the Congo ) made it plain once more that the cold war was all of a piece in space and time .Soviet Premier Khrushchev sent New Year's hopes for peace to President-elect Kennedy , and got a cool acknowledgment in reply .
Considering the state of the whole world , the cold war's three exposed fronts did not seem terribly ominous ; ;but , in Senator Gore's words , it was `` not a very encouraging '' situation that would confront John F. Kennedy on Inauguration Day .The Congressturmoil in the HouseAs the 87th Congress began its sessions last week , liberal Democrats were ready for a finish fight to open the sluice gates controlled by the House Rules Committee and permit the free flow of liberal legislation to the floor .
The liberal pressure bloc ( which coyly masquerades under the name Democratic Study Group ) had fought the committee before , and had always lost .This time , they were much better prepared and organized , and the political climate was favorable .They had the unspoken support of President-elect Kennedy , whose own legislative program was menaced by the Rules Committee bottleneck .And counting noses , they seemed to have the votes to work their will .Deadly deadlock .
There were two possible methods of breaching the conservative barriers around the Rules Committee : 1 ) to pack it with additional liberals and break the conservative-liberal deadlock , or 2 ) to remove one of the conservatives -- namely Mississippi's 14-term William Meyers Colmer ( pronounced Calmer ) .Caucusing , the liberals decided to go after Colmer , which actually was the more drastic course , since seniority in the House is next to godliness .A dour , gangling man with a choppy gait , Colmer looks younger than his 70 years , has gradually swung from a moderate , internationalist position to that of a diehard conservative .He is generally and initially suspicious of any federal project , unless it happens to benefit his Gulf Coast constituents .He is , of course , a segregationist , but he says he has never made an `` anti-Negro '' speech .
For 20 years he has enjoyed his power on the Rules Committee .There his vote , along with those of Chairman Howard Smith , the courtly Virginia judge , and the four Republican members , could and often did produce a 6-6 deadlock that blocked far-out , Democratic-sponsored welfare legislation ( a tactic often acceptable to the Rayburn-Johnson congressional leadership to avoid embarrassing votes ) .Equal treatment .There was sufficient pretext to demand Colmer's ouster : he had given his lukewarm support to the anti-Kennedy electors in Mississippi .Reprisals are not unheard of in such situations , but the recent tendency has been for the Congress to forgive its prodigal sons .
In 1949 the Dixiecrats escaped unscathed after their 1948 rebellion against Harry Truman , and in 1957 , after Congressman Adam Clayton Powell campaigned for Dwight Eisenhower in 1956 , his fellow Democrats did not touch his committee assignments , although they did strip him temporarily of his patronage .( In the heat of the anti-Colmer drive last week , Judge Smith threatened reprisal against Powell .Said he : `` We will see whether whites and Negroes are treated the same around here '' .) But Speaker Sam Rayburn , after huddling in Palm Beach with President-elect Kennedy , decided that this year something had to be done about the Rules Committee -- and that he was the only man who could do anything effective .In a tense , closed-door session with Judge Smith , Rayburn attempted to work out a compromise : to add three new members to the Rules Committee ( two Democrats , including one Southerner , and one Republican ) .
Smith flatly rejected the offer , and Mister Sam thereupon decided to join the rebels .The next morning he summoned a group of top Democrats to his private office and broke the news : he would lead the fight to oust Colmer , whom he is said to regard as `` an inferior man '' .News of Rayburn's commitment soon leaked out .When Missouri's Clarence Cannon got the word , he turned purple .`` Unconscionable '' ! !
He shouted , and rushed off to the Speaker's Room to object : `` A dangerous precedent '' ! !Cannon , a powerful , conservative man , brought welcome support to the Smith-Colmer forces : as chairman of the Appropriations Committee , he holds over each member the dreadful threat of excluding this or that congressional district from federal pork-barrel projects .Sitting quietly on an equally big pork barrel was another Judge Smith ally , Georgia's Carl Vinson , chairman of the Armed Services Committee .Threat of war .As the battle raged in the cloakrooms and caucuses , it became clear that Judge Smith could lose .
His highest count of supporters numbered 72 -- and he needed nearly twice that number to control the 260-member Democratic caucus .The liberals , smelling blood , were faced with the necessity of winning three big votes -- in the Democratic Committee on Committees , in the full party caucus , and on the floor of the House -- before they could oust Colmer .( One big question : If Colmer was to be purged , what should the House do about the other three senior Mississippians who supported the maverick electors ? ?) In all three arenas , they seemed certain of victory -- especially with Sam Rayburn applying his whiplash .But in the prospect of winning the battle loomed the specter of losing a costlier war .
If the Southerners were sufficiently aroused , they could very well cut the Kennedy legislative program to ribbons from their vantage point of committee chairmanships , leaving Sam Rayburn leading a truncated , unworkable party .With that possibility in mind , Arkansas' Wilbur Mills deliberately delayed calling a meeting of the Committee on Committees , and coolheaded Democrats sought to bring Rayburn and Smith together again to work out some sort of face-saving compromise .`` Here are two old men , mad at each other and too proud to pick up the phone '' , said a House Democratic leader .`` One wants a little more power , and the other doesn't want to give up any '' .Battle in the senate
The Senate launched the 87th Congress with its own version of an ancient liberal-conservative battle , but in contrast with the House's guerrilla war it seemed as pro forma as a Capitol guide's speech .Question at issue : How big a vote should be necessary to restrict Senate debate -- and thereby cut off legislation-delaying filibusters ? ?A wide-ranging , bipartisan force -- from Minnesota's Democratic Hubert Humphrey to Massachusetts' Republican Leverett Saltonstall -- was drawn up against a solid phalanx of Southern Democrats , who have traditionally used the filibuster to stop civil rights bills .New Mexico's Clint Anderson offered a resolution to change the Senate's notorious Rule 22 to allow three-fifths of the Senators present and voting to cut off debate , instead of the current hard-to-get two-thirds .Fair Dealer Humphrey upped the ante , asked cloture power for a mere majority of Senators .
Georgia's Dick Russell objected politely , and the battle was joined .Privately , the liberals admitted that the Humphrey amendment had no chance of passage .Privately , they also admitted that their hopes for Clint Anderson's three-fifths modification depended on none other than Republican Richard Nixon .In 1957 Nixon delivered a significant opinion that a majority of Senators had the power to adopt new rules at the beginning of each new Congress , and that any rules laid down by previous Congresses were not binding .Armed with the Nixon opinion , the Senate liberals rounded up their slim majority and prepared to choke off debate on the filibuster battle this week .
Hopefully , the perennial battle of Rule 22 then would be fought to a settlement once and for all .Republicanslast actSince Election Day , Vice President Richard Nixon had virtually retired -- by his own wish -- from public view .But with the convening of the new Congress , he was the public man again , presiding over the Senate until John Kennedy's Inauguration .
One day last week , Nixon faced a painful constitutional chore that required him to officiate at a joint session of Congress to hear the official tally of the Electoral College vote , and then to make `` sufficient declaration '' of the election of the man who defeated him in the tight 1960 presidential election .Nixon fulfilled his assignment with grace , then went beyond the required `` sufficient declaration '' .`` This is the first time in 100 years that a candidate for the presidency announced the result of an election in which he was defeated '' , he said .The Masters golf tournament proved last Monday what it can do to the strongest men and the staunchest nerves .Gary Player , the small , trim South African , was the eventual winner , but in all his 25 years he never spent a more harrowing afternoon as he waited for the victory to drop in his lap .
Arnold Palmer , the defending champion , lost his title on the 72nd hole after a few minutes of misfortune that left even his fellow pros gaping in disbelief .`` Just when you think you have it licked , this golf course can get up and bite you '' , Player had said one afternoon midway through the tournament .And that is just what happened on the last few holes .The Augusta National Golf Club Course got up and bit both Player and Palmer .Player was the first to feel its teeth .
After playing a splendid first nine holes in 34 -- two strokes under par -- on this fifth and final day of the tournament ( Sunday's fourth round had been washed out by a violent rainstorm when it was only half completed ) , Player's game rapidly fell to pieces .He bogeyed the 10th .After a journey through woods and stream he double-bogeyed the 13th .He bogeyed the 15th by missing a short putt and finally scrambled through the last three holes without further mishap for a 2-over-par 74 and a 72-hole total of 280 .As he signed his scorecard and walked off the course , Player was almost in tears .
He could read on the nearby scoreboard that Palmer , by then playing the 15th hole , was leading him by a stroke .Palmer had started the round four strokes behind Player , and at one point in the afternoon had trailed by as many as six strokes .Now all he had to do was finish in even par to collect the trophy and the biggest single paycheck in golf .When Palmer hit a good straight drive up the fairway on the 72nd hole , he seemed to have the championship won .But the seven-iron shot he used to approach the green strayed into a bunker and lodged in a slight depression .
In trying to hit it out with a sand wedge Palmer bounced the ball over the green , past spectators and down the slope toward a TV tower .Afterwards , Palmer told Charlie Coe , his last-round partner , that he simply played the hole too fast .He did seem hasty on his second and third shots , but then there was an agonizing wait of several minutes while Coe graciously putted out , giving Palmer a chance to recover his composure , which he had quite visibly lost .When the shaken Palmer finally did hit his fourth shot , he overshot the hole by 15 feet .Palmer was now putting merely for a tie , and Player , who was sitting beside his wife and watching it all on television in Tournament Chairman Clifford Roberts' clubhouse apartment , stared in amazement when Palmer missed the putt .
Palmer's 281 for the four rounds at Augusta was a comfortable four strokes ahead of the next closest pro , but it was barely good enough for a second-place tie with Coe .The lean and leathery Oklahoma amateur , who has been playing topnotch tournament golf for many years , refused to let the Masters jitters overtake him and closed the tournament with his second straight 69 .End at sevenUntil late last Saturday afternoon Palmer had played seven consecutive rounds of golf at the Masters -- four last year and three this -- without ever being out of first place .As evening approached and Palmer finished his Saturday round with a disappointing one-over-par 73 , this remarkable record was still intact , thanks to his Thursday and Friday rounds of 68 and 69 .
His three-round total of 210 was three strokes better than the next best score , a 213 by Bill Collins , the tall and deliberate Baltimorean who had been playing very well all winter long .But Palmer knew , as did everybody else at Augusta , that his streak was about to be broken .Half an hour after he finished his round , Player holed out at the 18th green with a 69 and a three-round total of 206 , four strokes ahead of Palmer .More than a streak had ended .Long after the erratic climate and the washed-out final round on Sunday have become meteorological footnotes , the 1961 Masters will be remembered as the scene of the mano a mano between Arnold Palmer and Gary Player .
Unlike most such sports rivalries , it appeared to have developed almost spontaneously , although this was not exactly the case .When the winter tour began at Los Angeles last January there was no one in sight to challenge Palmer's towering prestige .As if to confirm his stature , he quickly won three of the first eight tournaments .Player won only one .But as the tour reached Pensacola a month ago , Player was leading Palmer in official winnings by a few hundred dollars , and the rest of the field was somewhere off in nowhere .
On the final round at Pensacola , the luck of the draw paired Palmer and Player in the same threesome and , although it was far from obvious at the time , the gallery was treated to the first chapter of what promises to be one of the most exciting duels in sport for a long time to come .On that final Sunday at Pensacola neither Palmer nor Player was leading the tournament and , as it turned out , neither won it .But whichever of these two finished ahead of the other would be the undisputed financial leader of the tour .Player immediately proved he was not in the least awed by the dramatic proximity of Palmer .He outplayed Palmer all around the course and finished with a tremendous 65 to Palmer's 71 .
Thereafter , until the Masters , Player gradually increased his lead over Palmer in winnings and added one more tournament victory at Miami .When they reached Augusta last week , together they had won five of the 13 tournaments to date .Instant rivalryOn Thursday , the first day of the Masters , the contest between Palmer and Player developed instantly .It was a dismal , drizzly day but a good one on which to score over the Augusta National course .
The usually skiddy greens were moist and soft , so the golfers were able to strike their approach shots boldly at the flag-stick and putt firmly toward the hole without too much worry about the consequences .Palmer's 4-under-par 68 got him off to an early lead , which he shared with Bob Rosburg .But Player was only one stroke back , with a 69 .Even so , it was still not clear to many in the enormous horde of spectators -- unquestionably the largest golf crowd ever -- that this tournament was to be , essentially , a match between Palmer and Player .A lot of people were still thinking about Jack Nicklaus , the spectacular young amateur , who had a 70 ; ;
or Ken Venturi , who had a somewhat shaky 72 but was bound to do better ; ;or Rosburg , whose accurate short game and supersensitive putter can overcome so many of Augusta's treacheries ; ;or even old Byron Nelson , whose excellent 71 made one wonder if he had solved the geriatric aspects of golf .( On Thursday nobody except Charlie Coe was thinking of Charlie Coe .)
On Friday , a day as cloudless and lovely as Thursday had been gray and ugly , the plot of the tournament came clearly into focus .Rosburg had started early in the day , and by the time Palmer and Player were on the course -- separated , as they were destined to be for the rest of the weekend , by about half an hour -- they could see on the numerous scoreboards spotted around the course that Rosburg , who ended with a 73 , was not having a good day .As Player began his second round in a twosome with amateur Bill Hyndman , his share of the gallery was not conspicuously large for a contender .Player began with a birdie on the first hole , added five straight pars and then another birdie at the 9th .On the back nine he began to acquire the tidal wave of a gallery that stayed with him the rest of the tournament .
He birdied the 13th , the 15th and the 18th -- five birdies , one bogey and 12 pars for a 68 .Starting half an hour behind Player in company with British Open Champion Kel Nagle , Palmer birdied the 2nd , the 9th , the 13th and the 16th -- four birdies , one bogey and 13 pars for a 69 .The roar of Palmer's gallery as he sank a thrilling putt would roll out across the parklike landscape of Augusta , only to be answered moments later by the roar of Player's gallery for a similar triumph .At one point late in the day , when Palmer was lining up a 25-foot putt on the 16th , a thunderous cheer from the direction of the 18th green unmistakably announced that Player had birdied the final hole .Without so much as a grimace or a gesture to show that he had noticed ( although he later admitted that he had ) Palmer proceeded to sink his 25-footer , and his gallery sent its explosive vocalization rolling back along the intervening fairways in reply .
The boldness of championsAnyone who now doubted that a personal duel was under way had only to watch how these exceptionally gifted golfers were playing this most difficult golf course .It is almost axiomatic that golfers who dominate the game of golf for any period of time attack their shots with a vehemence bordering on violence .The bad luck that can so often mar a well-played round of golf is simply overpowered and obliterated by the contemptuous boldness of these champions .Bob Jones played that way .
Byron Nelson did , Hogan did .And last week at the Masters Palmer and Player did .As the third round of the tournament began on Saturday and the duel was resumed in earnest , it was Player's superior aggressiveness that carried him into the lead .This day Palmer had started first .As Player stepped on the first tee he knew that Palmer had birdied the first two holes and already was 2 under par for the day .
Player immediately proceeded to follow suit .In fact , he went on to birdie the 6th and 8th as well , to go 4 under par for the first eight holes .But Player's real test came on the ninth hole , a downhill dogleg to the left measuring 420 yards .He hit a poor tee shot , pulling it off into the pine woods separating the 9th and first fairways .Having hit one of the trees , the ball came to rest not more than 160 yards out .
Player then had the choice of punching the ball safely out of the woods to the 9th fairway and settling for a bogey 5 , or gambling .The latter involved hitting a full four-wood out to the first fairway and toward the clubhouse , hoping to slice it back to the deeply bunkered 9th green .`` I was hitting the ball well '' , Player said later , `` and I felt strong .When you're playing like that you'd better attack '' .Player attacked with his four-wood and hit a shot that few who saw it will ever forget .
It struck the 9th green on the fly and stopped just off the edge .From there he chipped back and sank his putt for a par 4 .Palmer , meanwhile , had been having his troubles .They started on the 4th hole , a 220-yard par-3 .On this day the wind had switched 180-degrees from the northwest to the southeast , and nearly every shot on the course was different from the previous few days .
At the 4th tee Palmer chose to hit a one-iron when a three-wood was the proper club , so he put the ball in a bunker in front of the green .His bogey 4 on this hole and subsequent bogeys at 5 and 7 along with a birdie at 8 brought him back to even par .Starting the second nine , Palmer was already four strokes behind Player and knew it .When Mickey Charles Mantle , the New York Yankees' man of muscle , drives a home run 450 feet into the bleachers , his feat touches upon the sublime .When Roger Eugene Maris , Mantle's muscular teammate , powers four home runs in a double-header , his performance merits awe .
But when tiny , 145-pound Albert Gregory Pearson of the Los Angeles Angels , who once caught three straight fly balls in center field because , as a teammate explained , `` the other team thought no one was out there '' , hits seven home runs in four months ( three more than his total in 1958 , 1959 , and 1960 ) , his achievement borders on the ridiculous .This is Baseball 1961 .This is the year home runs ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous .It is the year when ( 1 ) amiable Jim Gentile of the Baltimore Orioles ambled to the plate in consecutive innings with the bases loaded and , in unprecedented style , delivered consecutive grand-slam home runs ; ;( 2 ) Willie Mays of the San Francisco Giants borrowed a teammate's bat and became the ninth big leaguer to stroke four home runs in a game ; ;
( 3 ) the Milwaukee Braves tied a major-league record with fourteen home runs in three games and lost two of them ; ;and ( 4 ) catcher Johnny Blanchard of the New York Yankees matched a record with home runs in four successive times at bat , two of them as a pinch-hitter .Pitchers grumble about lively balls and lively bats , the shrinking strike zone , and the fact that the knock-down pitch is now illegal .Experts point to the thinning of pitching talent in the American League caused by expansion .Whatever the reasons , not in 30 years has a single season produced such thunderous assaults upon the bureau of baseball records , home-run division .
Of all the records in peril , one stands apart , dramatic in its making , dramatic in its endurance , and now , doubly dramatic in its jeopardy .This , of course , is baseball's most remarkable mark : The 60 home runs hit in 1927 by the incorrigible epicure , the incredible athlete , George Herman ( Babe ) Ruth of the Yankees .Since 1927 , fewer than a dozen men have made serious runs at Babe Ruth's record and each , in turn , has been thwarted .What ultimately frustrated every challenger was Ruth's amazing September surge .In the final month of the 1927 season , he hit seventeen home runs , a closing spurt never matched .
Double threat :Always , in the abortive attacks upon Ruth's record , one man alone -- a Jimmy Foxx ( 58 in 1932 ) or a Hank Greenberg ( 58 in 1938 ) or a Hack Wilson ( 56 in 1930 ) -- made the bid .But now , for the first time since Lou Gehrig ( with 47 home runs ) spurred Ruth on in 1927 , two men playing for the same team have zeroed in on 60 .Their names are Mantle and Maris , their team is the Yankees , and their threat is real .After 108 games in 1927 , Ruth had 35 home runs .
After 108 games in 1961 , Mickey Mantle has 43 , Roger Maris 41 .Extend Mantle's and Maris's present paces over the full 1961 schedule of 162 games , and , mathematically , each will hit more than 60 home runs .This is the great edge the two Yankees have going for them .To better Ruth's mark , neither needs a spectacular September flourish .All Mantle needs is eight more home runs in August and ten in September , and he will establish a new record .
In Ruth's day -- and until this year -- the schedule was 154 games .Baseball commissioner Ford Frick has ruled that Ruth's record will remain official unless it is broken in 154 games .)`` Even on the basis of 154 games , this is the ideal situation '' , insists Hank Greenberg , now vice-president of the Chicago White Sox .`` It has to be easier with two of them .
How can you walk Maris to get to Mantle '' ? ?Roommates :Neither Mantle nor Maris , understandably , will predict 60 home runs for himself .Although both concede they would like to hit 60 , they stick primarily to the baseball player's standard quote : `` The important thing is to win the pennant '' .But one thing is for certain : There is no dissension between Mantle , the American League's Most Valuable Player in 1956 and 1957 , and Maris , the MVP in 1960 .
Each enjoys seeing the other hit home runs ( `` I hope Roger hits 80 '' , Mantle says ) , and each enjoys even more seeing himself hit home runs ( `` and I hope I hit 81 '' ) .The sluggers get along so well in fact , that with their families at home for the summer ( Mantle's in Dallas , Maris's in Kansas City ) , they are rooming together .Mantle , Maris , and Bob Cerv , a utility outfielder , share an apartment in Jamaica , Long Island , not far from New York International Airport .The three pay $251 a month for four rooms ( kitchen , dining room , living room , and bedroom ) , with air-conditioning and new modern furniture .Mantle and Cerv use the twin beds in the bedroom ; ;
Maris sleeps on a green studio couch in the living room .They divide up the household chores : Cerv does most of the cooking ( breakfast and sandwich snacks , with dinner out ) , Mantle supplies the transportation ( a white 1961 Oldsmobile convertible ) , and Maris drives the 25-minute course from the apartment house to Yankee Stadium .Mantle , Maris , and Cerv probably share one major-league record already : Among them , they have fifteen children -- eight for Cerv , four for Mantle , and three for Maris .As roommates , teammates , and home-run mates , Mantle , 29 , who broke in with the Yankees ten years ago , and Maris , 26 , who came to the Yankees from Kansas City two years ago , have strikingly similar backgrounds .Both were scholastic stars in football , basketball , and baseball ( Mantle in Commerce , Okla. , Maris in Fargo , N.D. ) ; ;
as halfbacks , both came close to playing football at the University of Oklahoma ( `` Sometimes in the minors '' , Maris recalls , `` I wished I had gone to Oklahoma '' ) .To an extent , the two even look alike .Both have blue eyes and short blond hair .Both are 6 feet tall and weigh between 195 and 200 pounds , but Mantle , incredibly muscular ( he has a 17-1/2-inch neck ) , looks bigger .With their huge backs and overdeveloped shoulders , both must have their clothes made to order .
Maris purchases $100 suits from Simpson's in New York .Mantle , more concerned with dress , buys his suits four at a time at Neiman-Marcus in Dallas and pays as much as $250 each .Light reading :Neither Mantle nor Maris need fear being classified an intellectual , but lately Mantle has shown unusual devotion to an intellectual opus , Henry Miller's `` Tropic of Cancer '' .Mantle so appreciated Miller's delicate literary style that he broadened teammates' minds by reading sensitive passages aloud during road trips .
Mantle is not normally given to public speaking -- or , for that matter , to private speaking .`` What do you and Mickey talk about at home '' ? ?A reporter asked Maris recently .`` To tell you the truth '' , Maris said , `` Mickey don't talk much '' .This is no surprising trait for a ballplayer .
What is surprising and pleasant is that Mantle and Maris , under constant pressure from writers and photographers , are trying to be cooperative .Of the two , Mantle is by nature the less outgoing , Maris the more outspoken .But last week , when a reporter was standing near Mantle's locker , Mickey walked up and volunteered an anecdote .`` See that kid '' ? ?He said , pointing to a dark-haired 11-year-old boy .
`` That's ( Yogi ) Berra's .I'll never forget one time I struck out three times , dropped a fly ball , and we lost the game .I came back , sitting by my locker , feeling real low , and the kid walks over to me , looks up , and says : ' You stunk ' '' .Maris , in talking to reporters , tries to answer all questions candidly and fully , but on rare occasions , he shuns newsmen .`` When I've made a dumb play '' , he says , `` I don't want to talk to anyone .
I'm angry '' .By his own confession , Maris is an angry young man .Benched at Tulsa in 1955 , he told manager Dutch Meyer : `` I can't play for you .Send me where I can play '' .( Meyer sent him to Reading , Pa. .
) Benched at Indianapolis in 1956 , he told manager Kerby Farrell : `` I'm not learning anything on the bench .Play me '' .( Farrell did -- and Maris led the team to victory in the Little World Series .) `` That's the way I am '' , he says .`` I tell people what I think .
If you're a good ballplayer , you've got to get mad .Give me a team of nine angry men and I'll give you a team of nine gentlemen and we'll beat you nine out of ten times '' .Idols' idols :One good indication of the two men's personalities is the way they reacted to meeting their own heroes .Maris's was Ted Williams .
`` When I was a kid '' , Maris told a sportswriter last week , `` I used to follow Williams every day in the box score , just to see whether he got a hit or not '' .`` When you came up to the majors , did you seek out Williams for advice '' ? ?`` Are you kidding '' ? ?Said Maris .`` You're afraid to talk to a guy you idolize '' .
Mantle's hero was Joe DiMaggio .`` When Mickey went to the Yankees '' , says Mark Freeman , an ex-Yankee pitcher who sells mutual funds in Denver , `` DiMaggio still was playing and every day Mickey would go by his locker , just aching for some word of encouragement from this great man , this hero of his .But DiMaggio never said a word .It crushed Mickey .He told me he vowed right then that if he ever got to be a star , this never would be said of him '' .
Mantle has kept the vow .Among all the Yankees , he is the veteran most friendly to rookies .Neither Mantle nor Maris is totally devoted to baseball above all else .If laying ties on a railroad track , which he once did for $1 an hour , paid more than playing right field for the Yankees , Maris would lay ties on a railroad track .If working in a zinc mine , which he once did for 87-1/2 cents an hour , paid more than playing center field for the Yankees , Mantle would work in a zinc mine .
But since railroading and mining are not the highest paid arts , Mantle and Maris concentrate on baseball .They try to play baseball the best they can .Each is a complete ballplayer .Mantle , beyond any question , can do more things well .( `` One of the reasons they get along fine '' , says a sportswriter who is friendly with the two men , `` is that both realize Mantle is head-and-shoulders above Maris '' .
) Hitting , Mantle has an immediate advantage because he bats both left-handed and right-handed , Maris only left-handed .They both possess near classic stances , dug in firmly , arms high , set for fierce swings .Mantle is considerably better hitting for average (, fourth in the league , tofor Maris so far this year ) .
Both are good bunters : Maris once beat out eighteen of nineteen in the minor leagues ; ;Mantle is a master at dragging a bunt toward first base .Both have brilliant speed : Mantle was timed from home plate ( batting left-handed ) to first base in 3.1 seconds , faster than any other major leaguer ; ;Maris ran the 100-yard dash in ten seconds in high school and once won a race against Luis Aparicio , the swift , base-stealing shortstop of the White Sox .Both are good , daring fielders : Mantle covers more ground ; ;
Maris's throwing arm is stronger .Yet with all their skills , the appeal of Mantle and Maris in 1961 comes down to one basic : The home run .With this ultimate weapon , the two Yankees may have saved baseball from its dullest season .( American League expansion created , inevitably , weaker teams .Only two teams in each league ( the Yankees and Detroit , the Dodgers and Cincinnati ) are battling for first place .
Appropriately , the emphasis on the home run , at a peak this year , came into being at baseball's lowest moment .In 1920 , as the startling news that the 1919 White Sox had conspired to lose the World Series leaked out , fans grew disillusioned and disinterested in baseball .Something was needed to revive interest ; ;the something was the home run .Into Washington on President-elect John F. Kennedy's Convair , the Caroline , winged Actor-Crooner Frank Sinatra and his close Hollywood pal , Cinemactor Peter Lawford , Jack Kennedy's brother-in-law .
Also included in the entourage : a dog in a black sweater , Frankie and Peter had an urgent mission : to stage a mammoth Inauguration Eve entertainment gala in the capital's National Guard Armory .Frankie was fairly glutted with ideas , as he had hinted upon his arrival : `` It's really tremendous when you think Ella Fitzgerald is coming from Australia .I could talk to you for three hours and still not be able to give you all of our plans '' ! !As the plans were laid , some several thousand fat cats were to be ensconced in the armory's $100 seats and in 68 ringside boxes priced at $10,000 each .The biggest single act would doubtless be staged by Frankie himself : his Inaugural wardrobe had been designed by Hollywood Couturier Don Loper , who regularly makes up ladies' ensembles .
Soon after Loper leaked the news that Frankie had ordered `` two of everything '' just `` in case he spills anything '' , Frankie got so mad at the chic designer that he vowed he would not wear a stitch of Loper clothing .A year after he was catapulted over nine officers senior to him and made commandant of the Marine Corps , General David M. Shoup delivered a peppery annual report in the form of a `` happy , warless New Year '' greeting to his Pentagon staff .Said Leatherneck Shoup : `` A year ago I took the grips of the plow in my hands .After pushing an accumulation of vines and weeds from the moldboard , I lifted the lines from the dust and found hitched to that plow the finest team I ever held a rein on .Little geeing and hawing have been necessary '' .
But Shoup also gave the Corps a tilling in spots .Speaking of `` pride '' , he deplored the noncommissioned officer `` whose uniform looks like it belonged to someone who retired in 1940 ; ;the officer with the yellow socks or the bay window .A few of these people are still around '' .Old and new briefly crossed paths in the U.S. Senate , then went their respective ways .
At a reception for new members of Congress , Oregon Democrat Maurine Neuberger , taking the Senate seat held by her husband Richard until his death last March , got a brotherly buss from Democratic Elder Statesman Adlai Stevenson , U.S. Ambassador-designate to the U.N. .Meanwhile , after 24 years in the Senate , Rhode Island's durable Democrat Theodore Francis Greene -- having walked , swum and cerebrated himself to the hearty age of 93 -- left that august body ( voluntarily , because he could surely have been re-elected had he chosen to run again last November ) , as the oldest man ever to serve in the Senate .The most famous undergraduate of South Philadelphia High School is a current bobby-sox idol , Dreamboat Cacophonist Fabian ( real name : Fabian Forte ) , 17 , and last week it developed that he will remain an undergraduate for a while .The principal of the school announced that -- despite the help of private tutors in Hollywood and Philadelphia -- Fabian is a 10-o'clock scholar in English and mathematics .Lacking his needed credits in those subjects , Fabian will not graduate with his old classmates next week .
South Philadelphia High's principal added that the current delay was caused by the `` pressure '' of a movie that the toneless lad was making .To Decathlon Man Rafer Johnson ( Time cover , Aug. 29 ) , whose gold medal in last summer's Olympic Games was won as much on gumption as talent , went the A.A.U.'s James E. Sullivan Memorial Trophy as the outstanding U.S. amateur athlete of 1960 .As the world's top sportsman -- pro or amateur -- Sports Illustrated tapped golf's confident Arnold Palmer ( Time cover , May 2 ) , who staged two cliffhanging rallies to win both the Masters and U.S. Open crowns , went on to win a record $80,738 for the year .Tooling through Sydney on his way to race in the New Zealand Grand Prix , Britain's balding Ace Driver Stirling Moss , 31 , all but smothered himself in his own exhaust of self-crimination .`` I'm a slob '' , he announced .
`` My taste is gaudy .I'm useless for anything but racing cars .I'm ruddy lazy , and I'm getting on in years .It gets so frustrating , but then again I don't know what I could do if I gave up racing '' .Has Moss no stirling virtues ? ?
`` I appreciate beauty '' .One of Nikita Khrushchev's most enthusiastic eulogizers , the U.S.S.R.'s daily Izvestia , enterprisingly interviewed Red-prone Comedian Charlie Chaplin at his Swiss villa , where he has been in self-exile since 1952 .Chaplin , 71 , who met K. when the Soviet boss visited England in 1956 , confided that he hopes to visit Russia some time this summer because `` I have marveled at your grandiose experiment and I believe in your future '' .Then Charlie spooned out some quick impressions of the Nikita he had glimpsed : `` I was captivated by his humor , frankness and good nature and by his kind , strong and somewhat sly face '' .G. David Thompson is one of those names known to the stewards of transatlantic jetliners and to doormen in Europe's best hotels , but he is somewhat of an enigma to most people in his own home town of Pittsburgh .
There the name vaguely connotes new-rich wealth , a reputation for eccentricity , and an ardor for collecting art .Last week , in the German city of Dusseldorf , G. David Thompson was making headlines that could well give Pittsburgh pause .On display were 343 first-class paintings and sculptures from his fabled collection -- and every single one of them was up for sale .Like Philadelphia's late Dr. Albert C. Barnes who kept his own great collection closed to the general public ( Time , Jan. 2 ) , Thompson , at 61 , is something of a legend in his own lifetime .He made his fortune during World War 2 , when he took over a number of dying steel plants and kept them alive until the boom .
Even before he hit big money , he had begun buying modern paintings .He gave the impression of never having read a word about art , but there was no doubt that he had an eye for the best .He was able to smell a bargain -- and a masterpiece -- a continent away , and the Museum of Modern Art's Alfred Barr said of him : `` I have never mentioned a new artist that Thompson didn't know about '' .He might barge into a gallery , start haggling over prices without so much as a word of greeting .He could be lavishly generous with friends , cab drivers and bellboys , but with dealers he was tough .
He bought up Cezannes , Braques , Matisses , Legers , a splendid Picasso series , more than 70 Giacometti sculptures .He gathered one of the biggest collections of Paul Klees in the world .All these he hung in his burglarproof home called Stone's Throw , outside Pittsburgh , and only people he liked and trusted ever got to see them .Two years ago Thompson offered his collection to the city .But he insisted that it be housed in a special museum .
Pittsburgh turned him down , just as Pittsburgh society had been snubbing him for years .He went then to a 40-year-old Basel art dealer named Ernst Beyeler , with whom he had long been trading pictures .Last year Beyeler arranged to sell $1,500,000 worth of Klees to the state of North Rhine-Westphalia , which will house them in a museum that is yet to be built .Last week most of the other prizes , once offered to Pittsburgh , went on the block .At the opening of the Dusseldorf show , Thompson himself scarcely glanced at the treasures that he was seeing together for the last time .
In fact he seemed delighted to get rid of them .Some observers speculated that this might be his revenge on his home town .Thompson himself said : `` I want to enjoy once more the pleasure of bare walls waiting for new pictures '' .Break in GeorgiaThe University of Georgia has long claimed that it does not discriminate against any applicant on the basis of race or color .
But in all its 175 years , not a single Negro student has entered its classrooms .Last week Federal District Judge William A. Bootle ordered the university to admit immediately a `` qualified '' Negro boy and girl .Their entry will crack the total segregation of all public education , from kindergarten through graduate school , in Georgia -- and in Alabama , Mississippi and South Carolina as well .For 18 months , Hamilton Holmes , 19 , and Charlayne Hunter , 18 , had tried to get into the university .They graduated together from Atlanta's Turner High School , where Valedictorian Holmes was first in the class and Charlayne third .
The university rejected them on a variety of pretexts , but was careful never to mention the color of their skins .Holmes went to Atlanta's Morehouse ( Negro ) College , where he is a B student and star halfback .Charlayne studied journalism at Detroit's Wayne State University .Last fall , after they took their hopes for entering Georgia to court , Judge Bootle ordered them to apply again .Charlayne was `` tentatively '' admitted for next fall , after state investigators questioned her white roommate at Wayne State .
But Holmes was rejected again `` on the basis of his record and interview '' .The evidence in court was testimony about the interview , which for Holmes lasted an hour , although at least one white student at Georgia got through this ritual by a simple phone conversation .Holmes was asked if he had ever visited a house of prostitution , or a `` beatnik parlor or teahouse '' .No , said he , but officials still called him `` evasive '' .They also said he lied in saying that he had never been `` arrested '' .
Their reason : Holmes once paid a $20 speeding fine , had his license suspended .Negro lawyers dug into the records of 300 white students , found that many were hardly interviewed at all -- and few had academic records as good as Hamilton Holmes .The real reason for his rejection , they argued , is the fact that Georgia law automatically cuts off funds for any desegregated school .Judge Bootle's decision : `` The two plaintiffs are qualified for admission to said university and would already have been admitted had it not been for their race and color '' .The state will appeal -- but few think it will actually try to close the university .
`` Surprised and pleased '' , Students Holmes and Hunter may enter the University of Georgia this week .Catch for ChicagoWhen the University of Chicago's Chancellor Lawrence A. Kimpton submitted his resignation last March , a mighty talent hunt gripped the Midway .Out went letters to 60,000 old grads , asking for suggestions .Such academic statesmen as James B. Conant were consulted .
Two committees pondered 375 possible Kimpton successors , including Adlai Stevenson , Richard Nixon , and Harvard's Dean McGeorge Bundy .The debate led to a decision that Chicago needed neither a big name nor an experienced academic administrator , but rather , as Trustee Chairman Glen A. Lloyd put it , `` a top scholar in his own right '' -- a bright light to lure other top scholars to Chicago .Last week Chicago happily found its top scholar in Caltech's acting dean of the faculty : dynamic Geneticist George Wells Beadle , 57 , who shared the 1958 Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology for discovering how genes affect heredity by controlling cell chemistry ( Time , Cover , July 14 , 1958 ) .It fell to Chancellor Kimpton , now a Standard Oil ( Indiana ) executive , to spend his nine-year reign tidying up Chicago after the 21-year typhoon of Idealist Robert Maynard Hutchins .He threw out some of Hutchins' more wildly experimental courses , raised sagging undergraduate enrollment to 2,100 , nearly doubled endowment to $139.3 million .
But though Kimpton put Chicago in what he felt was working order , some old grads feel that it still needs the kind of lively teachers who filled it in the heady Hutchins era .At Caltech , Geneticist Beadle has stuck close to his research as head of the school's famous biology division since 1946 .But he has shown a sixth-sense ability to spot , recruit and excite able researchers , and has developed unexpected talents in fund raising and speech-making .Beadle is even that rare scientist who takes an interest in money matters ; ;he avidly reads the Wall Street Journal , and took delight in driving a $250 model A Ford for 22 years , then selling it for $300 .
A philosopher may point out that the troubles of the Congo began with the old Adam and consequently will never end .But a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date , and hold out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass away .The man was King Leopold 2 , of the Belgians , who in 1885 concluded that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing was still good .By force , he took under his protection , or stole , 900,000 square miles of wilderness in Central Africa .This is an area nearly as large as Western Europe ; ;
and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political or historical unity .Its boundaries had nothing to do with geography or ethnic groupings ; ;they were determined by the points at which Leopold's explorers and gunmen got tired of walking .The population of the Congo is 13.5 million , divided into at least seven major `` culture clusters '' and innumerable tribes speaking 400 separate dialects .The religions of the people include Christianity , Mohammedanism , paganism , ancestor worship and animism .
The climate ranges from the steamily equatorial to the temperate .The hospitals contain patients trampled by elephants or run over by sports cars .To make one nation out of these disparities would be a problem large enough in any case ; ;it has been made far more difficult by what the Belgians have done , or failed to do , in the Congo since 1885 .At first the Belgian royal family administered the Congo as its own private property .
But by 1908 its record of brutality had touched the national conscience .The Belgian government itself took over administration , commencing a program of paternalism unmatched in the history of colonialism .One definition of paternalism is `` The principle or practice , on the part of a government , of managing the affairs of a country in the manner of a father dealing with his children '' .The honor of the Belgians in this matter is not to be questioned -- only their judgment .Ordinarily a father permits his children to grow up in due time -- but when the colony received independence in 1960 the Congolese child , if one imagines him to have been born in 1908 , was 52 and had until then been treated as an infant .
The Belgians were interested primarily in the economic development of the Congo , which is rich in copper , tin , cobalt , manganese , zinc , and uranium , and cotton and palm oil .The colony was administered from Brussels , with neither the Congolese nor the resident Belgians having any vote .The beneficiaries of this administration were a number of huge cartels in which both individuals and the Belgian government itself held stock .In Inside Africa , John Gunther describes one of these , the Societe Generale , as `` the kind of colossus that might be envisaged if , let us say , the House of Morgan , Anaconda Copper , the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York , the Pennsylvania Railroad , and various companies producing agricultural products were lumped together , with the United States government as a heavy partner '' .Had they been truly ruthless , the Belgians might have exploited the Congolese without compassion .
But they were not .They provided a social security system which covered all their African employes ; ;their program of mass medical care was doubtless the best on the continent ; ;they put much effort into public housing .They also instituted a ration system under which all employers in the Congo were required to furnish their employes with clothing and adequate food .
But instead of delivering the ration -- either in actual commodities or in cash -- at intervals of perhaps two weeks or a month , the Belgians felt obliged to dole it out more often .Would not the children , if they received all their food on the first day of the month , eat it up immediately , and later go hungry ? ?The Belgians also placed great emphasis on education .During the 1950s there were as many as 25,000 schools in the Congo .But almost all the schools were primary .
The average Congolese can do little more than puzzle out the meaning of `` la chatte '' and `` le chien '' and write his name .Some schools were technical -- the Belgians needed carpenters and mechanics to help exploit the land , and trained many .But they did not believe in widespread secondary education , much less in college .It was their conviction that the people should be `` brought up together '' , a grade at a time , until in some indefinite future some might be ready to tackle history , economics and political science .Indeed , the Belgians discouraged higher education , fearing the creation of a native intellectual elite which might cause unrest .
When the Congo received its independence in 1960 there were , among its 13.5 million people , exactly 14 university graduates .Why did the Belgians grant independence to a colony so manifestly unprepared to accept it ? ?In one large oversimplification , it might be said that the Belgians felt , far too late , the gale of nationalism sweeping Africa .They lacked time to prepare the Congo , as the British and French had prepared their colonies .The Congolese were clamoring for their independence , even though most were unsure what it meant ; ;
and in Brussels , street crowds shouted , `` Pas une goutte de sang ! !'' ( Not one drop of blood ! !) .The Belgians would not fight for the privilege of being the detested pedagogue ; ;rather than teach where teaching was not wanted , they would wash their hands of the mess .
It is hard to blame them for this .Yet there were other motivations and actions which the Belgians took after independence for which history may not find them guiltless .As the time for independence approached there were in the Congo no fewer than 120 political parties , or approximately eight for each university graduate .There were four principal ones .First , there were those Congolese ( among them Joseph Kasavubu ) who favored splitting the country into small independent states , Balkanizing it .
Second , there were those ( Moise Tshombe ) who favored near-Balkanization , a loose federalism having a central government of limited authority , with much power residing in the states .Third , there were those ( notably Patrice Lumumba ) who favored a unified Congo with a very strong central government .And fourth , there were moderates who were in no hurry for independence and wished to wait until the Congo grew up .However , the positions of all parties and leaders were constantly shifting .A final factor which contributed greatly to the fragmentation of the Congo , immediately after independence , was the provincial structure that had been established by the Belgians for convenience in administration .
They had divided the Congo into six provinces -- Leopoldville , Kasai , Kivu , Katanga , Equator and Eastern -- unfortunately with little regard for ethnic groupings .Thus some provinces contained tribes which detested each other , and to them independence meant an opportunity for war .The Belgian Congo was granted its independence with what seemed a workable Western-style form of government : there were to be a president and a premier , and a bicameral legislature elected by universal suffrage in the provinces .Well-wishers around the world hoped that the Congo would quickly assume a respectable position in the society of nations .If internal frictions arose , they could be handled by the 25,000-man Congolese army , the Force Publique , which had been trained and was still officered by white Belgians .
The president , Joseph Kasavubu , seemed an able administrator and the premier , Patrice Lumumba , a reasonable man .Twenty-four hours after independence the wild tribesmen commenced fighting each other .Presently the well-armed members of the Force Publique -- many of them drawn from savage and even cannibalistic tribes , erupted in mutiny , rioting , raping and looting .Terror engulfed the thousands of Belgian civilians who had remained in the country .The Belgian government decided to act , and on July 10 dispatched paratroops to the Congo .
On July 11 the head of the mineral-rich province of Katanga , Moise Tshombe , announced that his province had seceded from the country .Confusion became chaos ; ;each succeeding day brought new acts of violence .Lumumba and Kasavubu blamed it all on the military intervention by the Belgians , and appealed to the United Nations to send troops to oust them .On July 14 the Security Council -- with France and Great Britain abstaining -- voted the resolution which drew the U.N. into the Congo .
Vague in wording , it called for withdrawal of Belgian troops and authorized the Secretary-General `` to take the necessary steps to provide the ( Congolese ) Government with such military assistance as may be necessary , until , through the efforts of the Congolese Government with the technical assistance of the United Nations , the national security forces may be able , in the opinion of the Government , to meet fully their tasks .''Secretary-General Hammarskjold decided that it would be preferable if the U.N. troops sent into the Congo were to come from African , or at least nonwhite , nations -- certainly not from the U.S. , Russia , Great Britain or France .He quickly called on Ghana , Tunisia , Morocco , Guinea and Mali , which dispatched troops within hours .Ultimately the U.N. army in the Congo reached a top strength of 19,000 , including about 5,000 from India and a few soldiers from Eire and Sweden , who were the only whites .
It took the U.N. three months to bring a modest form of order to the Congo .The Belgians were reluctant to withdraw their troops and often obstructed U.N. efforts .The wildly erratic nature of Patrice Lumumba caused constant problems -- he frequently announced that he wanted the U.N. to get out of the Congo along with the Belgians , and appealed to Russia for help .( However , there is little evidence that the late Lumumba was a Communist .Before appealing to the U.N. or to Russia , he first appealed to the U.S. for military help , and was rejected .
) Lumumba further complicated the U.N.'s mission by initiating small `` wars '' with the secessionist province of Katanga and with South Kasai which , under Albert Kalonji , wanted to secede as well .Meanwhile Russia took every opportunity to meddle in the Congo , sending Lumumba equipment for his `` wars '' , dispatching `` technicians '' and even threatening , on occasion , to intervene openly .But by the end of the three-month period , in October 1960 , something approaching calm settled on the Congo .President Kasavubu became exasperated with Lumumba and fired him .Lumumba fired Kasavubu .
Control of the government -- such control as there was and such government as there was -- passed into the hands of Joseph Mobutu , chief of staff of the Congolese army .Mobutu promptly flung out the Russians , who have not since played any significant part on the local scene , although they have redoubled their obstructionist efforts at U.N. headquarters in New York .The Belgians -- at least officially -- departed from the Congo as well , withdrawing all of their uniformed troops .But they left behind them large numbers of officers , variously called `` volunteers '' or `` mercenaries '' , who now staff the army of Moise Tshombe in Katanga , the seceded province which , according to Tshombe , holds 65% of the mineral wealth of the entire country .From October 1960 to February 1961 , the U.N. forces in the Congo took little action .
There was no directive for it -- the Security Council's resolution had not mentioned political matters , and in any case the United Nations by the terms of its charter may not interfere in the political affairs of any nation , whether to unify it , federalize it or Balkanize it .During the five-month lull , civil war smoldered and flickered throughout the Congo .In February the murder of Patrice Lumumba , who had been kidnaped into Katanga and executed on order of Tshombe , again stirred the U.N. to action .On Feb. 21 the council passed another resolution urging the taking of `` all appropriate measures to prevent the occurrence of civil war in the Congo , including the use of force , if necessary , in the last resort '' .Although the resolution might have been far more specific , it was considerably tougher than the earlier one .
It also urged that the U.N. eject , and prevent the return of , all Belgian and other foreign military and political advisers ; ;ordered an investigation of Lumumba's death ; ;urged the reconvention of the Congolese Parliament and the reorganization of the army .The presidency : talking and listeningThough President John F. Kennedy was primarily concerned with the crucial problems of Berlin and disarmament adviser McCloy's unexpected report from Khrushchev , his new enthusiasm and reliance on personal diplomacy involved him in other key problems of U.S. foreign policy last week .
High up on the President's priority list was the thorny question of Bizerte .On this issue , the President received a detailed report from his U.N. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson , who had just returned from Paris , and Mr. Kennedy asked Stevenson to search for a face-saving way -- for both Paris and Tunis -- out of the imbroglio .Ideally , the President would like the French to agree on a `` status quo ante '' on Bizerte , and accept a new timetable for withdrawing their forces from the Mediterranean base .To continue their important conversations about the Tunisian issue and the whole range of other problems , Mr. Kennedy invited Stevenson to Cape Cod for the weekend .The President also discussed the Bizerte deadlock with the No. 2 man in the Tunisian Government , Defense Minister Bahi Ladgham , who flew to Washington last week to seek U.S. support .
The conversation apparently convinced Mr. Kennedy that the positions of France and Tunisia were not irreconcilable .Through Ladgham , Mr. Kennedy sent a message along those lines to Tunisian President Habib Bourguiba ; ;and one U.S. official said : `` The key question now is which side picks up the phone first '' .On the Latin American front , the President held talks with Secretary of the Treasury Douglas Dillon before sending him to Uruguay and the Inter-American Economic and Social Council ( which the President himself had originally hoped to attend ) .Main purpose of the meeting : To discuss President Kennedy's Alliance for Progress .
And that was not all .In conferences with Nationalist China's dapper , diminutive Vice President Chen Cheng , Mr. Kennedy assured Chiang Kai-shek's emissary that the U.S. is as firmly opposed as ever to the admission of Red China to the United Nations .Chen was equally adamant in his opposition to the admission of Outer Mongolia ; ;however the President , who would like to woo the former Chinese province away from both Peking and Moscow , would promise Chen nothing more than an abstention by the U.S. if Outer Mongolia's admission comes to a vote .The President also conferred with emissaries from Guatemala and Nepal who are seeking more foreign aid .
To Africa , he sent his most trusted adviser , his brother , Attorney General Robert Kennedy , on a good-will mission to the Ivory Coast .All week long the President clearly was playing a larger personal role in foreign affairs ; ;in effect , he was practicing what he preached in his Berlin message two weeks ago when he declared : `` We shall always be prepared to discuss international problems with any and all nations that are willing to talk , and listen , with reason '' .Crime : ' skyjacked 'From International Airport in Los Angeles to International Airport in Houston , as the great four-jet Boeing 707 flies , is a routine five hours and 25 minutes , including stopovers at Phoenix , El Paso , and San Antonio .
When Continental Airlines night-coach Flight 54 took off at 11:30 one night last week , there was no reason to think it would take any longer .The plane put down on schedule at 1:35 a.m. in Phoenix .Thirty-one minutes later , when it took off for El Paso , hardly anyone of the crew of six or the 65 other passengers paid any attention to the man and teen-age boy who had come aboard .At 3:57 a.m. , with the plane about twenty minutes out of El Paso , passenger Robert Berry , a San Antonio advertising man , glanced up and saw the man and boy , accompanied by a stewardess , walking up the aisle toward the cockpit .`` The man was bent over with his hand on his stomach '' , Berry said .
`` I figured he was sick '' .John Salvador , a farmer from Palm Desert , Calif. , was sitting up front and could see through the door as the trio entered the cockpit .`` The kid had a automatic , like they issue in the Army '' , he said .`` The other fellow had a '' .Salvador saw the youth hold his against the head of stewardess Lois Carnegey ; ;
the man put his at the head of Capt. Byron D. Rickards .To Rickards , a 52-year-old veteran 30 years in the air , it was an old story : His plane was being hijacked in mid-flight again much as it had happened in 1930 , when Peruvian rebels made him land a Ford tri-motor at Arequipa .But last week's pirates , like the Cuban-American who recently hijacked an Eastern Airlines Electra ( Newsweek , Aug. 7 ) , wanted to go to Havana .Stalling :`` Tell your company there are four of us here with guns '' , the elder man told Rickards .
The pilot radioed El Paso International Airport with just that message .But , he told the `` skyjackers '' , the 707 didn't carry enough fuel to reach Havana ; ;they would have to refuel at El Paso .Most passengers didn't know what had happened until they got on the ground .Jerry McCauley of Sacramento , Calif. , one of some twenty Air Force recruits on board , awoke from a nap in confusion .
`` The old man came from the front of the plane and said he wanted four volunteers to go to Cuba '' , McCauley said , `` and like a nut I raised my hand .I thought he was the Air Force recruiter '' .What the man wanted was four persons to volunteer as hostages , along with the crew .They chose four : Jack Casey , who works for Continental Airlines in Houston ; ;Fred Mullen from Mercer Island , Wash. ; ;
Pfc. Truman Cleveland of St. Augustine .Fla. , and Leonard Gilman , a former college boxer and veteran of the U.S. Immigration Service Border Patrol .Everybody else was allowed to file off the plane after it touched down at El Paso at 4:18 a.m. .They found a large welcoming group -- El Paso policemen , Border Patrol , sheriff's deputies , and FBI men , who surged around the plane with rifles and submachine guns .Other FBI men , talking with the pilot from the tower , conspired with him to delay the proposed flight to Havana .
The ground crew , which ordinarily fuels a 707 in twenty minutes , took fully three hours .Still more time was consumed while the pilot , at the radioed suggestion of Continental president Robert Six , tried to persuade the armed pair to swap the Boeing jet for a propeller-driven Douglas Aj .Actually , the officers on the ground had no intention of letting the hijackers get away with any kind of an airplane ; ;they had orders to that effect straight from President Kennedy , who thought at first , as did most others , that it was four followers of Cuba's Fidel Castro who had taken over the 707 .Mr. Kennedy had been informed early in the day of the attempt to steal the plane , kept in touch throughout by telephone .
At one time , while still under the impression that he was dealing with a Cuban plot , the President talked about invoking a total embargo on trade with Cuba .As the morning wore on and a blazing West Texas sun wiped the shadows off the Franklin Mountains , police got close enough to the plane to pry into the baggage compartment .From the luggage , they learned that the two air pirates , far from being Cubans , were native Americans , subsequently identified as Leon Bearden , 50-year-old ex-convict from Coolidge , Ariz. , and his son , Cody , 16 , a high-school junior .TensionThe heat and strain began to tell on the Beardens .
The father , by accident or perhaps to show , as he said , `` we mean business '' , took the and fired a slug between the legs of Second Officer Norman Simmons .At 7:30 a.m. , more than three hours after landing , the Beardens gave an ultimatum :Take off or see the hostages killed .The tower cleared the plane for take-off at 8 a.m. , and Captain Rickards began taxiing toward the runway .Several police cars , loaded with armed officers , raced alongside , blazing away at the tires of the big jet .
The slugs flattened ten tires and silenced one of the inboard engines ; ;the plane slowed to a halt .Ambulances , baggage trucks , and cars surrounded it .The day wore on .At 12:50 p.m. a ramp was rolled up to the plane .
A few minutes later , FBI agent Francis Crosby , talking fast , eased up the ramp to the plane , unarmed .While Crosby distracted the Beardens , stewardesses Carnegey and Toni Besset dropped out of a rear door .So did hostages Casey , Cleveland , and Mullen .That left only the four crew members , Crosby , and Border Patrolman Gilman , all unarmed , with the Beardens .The elder Bearden had one pistol in his hand , the other in a hip pocket .
Gilman started talking to him until he saw his chance .He caught officer Simmons' eye , nodded toward young Bearden , and -- `` I swung my right as hard as I could .Simmons and Crosby jumped the boy and it was all over '' .Frog-marched off the airplane at 1:48 p.m. , the Beardens were held in bail of $100,000 each on charges of kidnapping and transporting a stolen plane across state lines .( Bearden reportedly hoped to peddle the plane to Castro , and live high in Cuba .
) Back home in Coolidge , Ariz. , his 36-year-old wife , Mary , said : `` I thought they were going to Phoenix to look for jobs '' .Congress : more muscleTaking precedence over all other legislation on Capitol Hill last week was the military strength of the nation .The Senate put other business aside as it moved with unaccustomed speed and unanimity to pass -- 85 to 0 -- the largest peacetime defense budget in U.S. history .With the money all but in hand , however , the Administration indicated that , instead of the 225,000 more men in uniform that President Kennedy had requested , the armed forces would be increased by only 160,000 .
The `` hold-back '' , as Pentagon mutterers labeled it , apparently was a temporary expedient intended to insure that the army services are built up gradually and , thus , the new funds spent prudently .In all , the Senate signed a check for $46.7 billion , which not only included the extra $3.5 billion requested the week before by President Kennedy , but tacked on $754 million more than the President had asked for .( The Senate , on its own , decided to provide additional B-52 and other long-range bombers for the Strategic Air Command .) The House , which had passed its smaller appropriation before the President's urgent call for more , was expected to go along with the increased defense budget in short order .In other areas , Congressional action last week included :
The Senate ( by voice vote ) and the House ( by 224-170 ) passed and sent to the White House the compromise farm bill which the President is expected to sign , not too unhappily .The Senate also voted $5.2 billion to finance the government's health , welfare , and labor activities .Debate on the all-important foreign-aid bill , with its controversial long-range proposals , had just begun on the Senate floor at the weekend .White House legislative aides were still confident the bill would pass intact .Food : stew a la Mulligatawny
Most members of the U.S. Senate , because they are human , like to eat as high on the hog as they can .But , because they are politicians , they like to talk as poor-mouth as the lowliest voter .As a result , ever since 1851 when the Senate restaurant opened in the new wing of the Capitol Building , the senators have never ceased to grumble about the food -- even while they opposed every move that might improve it .Over the years , enlivened chiefly by disputes about the relative merits of Maine and Idaho potatoes , the menu has pursued its drab all-American course .Individual senators , with an eye to the voters back home , occasionally introduced smelts from Michigan , soft-shell crabs from Maryland , oysters from Washington , grapefruit from Florida .
But plain old bean soup , served daily since the turn of the century ( at the insistence of the late Sen. Fred Dubois of Idaho ) , made clear to the citizenry that the Senate's stomach was in the right place .In a daring stroke , the Senate ventured forth last week into the world of haute cuisine and hired a $10,000-per-year French-born maitre d'hotel .Holders of toll-road bonds are finding improvements in monthly reports on operation of the turnpikes .Long-term trend of traffic on these roads seems clearly upward .Higher toll rates also are helping boost revenues .
Result is a better prospect for a full payoff by bonds that once were regarded as highly speculative .Things are looking up these days for many of the State turnpikes on which investors depend for income from their toll-road bonds .Traffic on nearly all the turnpikes has been growing .That added traffic means rising streams of dimes and quarters at toll gates .As a result of the new outlook for turnpikes , investors who bought toll-road bonds when these securities ranked as outright speculations are now finding new hope for their investments .
Another result is that buyers are tending to bid up the prices of these tax-exempt bonds .Other tax-exempt bonds of State and local governments hit a price peak on February 21 , according to Standard & Poor's average .On balance , prices of those bonds have slipped a bit since then .However , in the same three-month period , toll-road bonds , as a group , have bucked this trend .On these bonds , price rises since February 21 easily outnumber price declines .
Tax-free returns .Investors , however , still see an element of more-than-ordinary risk in the toll-road bonds .You find the evidence of that in the chart on this page .Many of the toll-road bonds still are selling at prices that offer the prospect of an annual yield of 4 per cent , or very close to that .And this is true in the case of some turnpikes on which revenues have risen close to , or beyond , the point at which the roads start to pay all operating costs plus annual interest on the bonds .
That 4 per cent yield is well below the return to be had on good corporation bonds .It's not much more , in fact , than the return that is offered on U. S. Treasury bonds .For investors whose income is taxed at high rates , though , a tax-free yield of 4 per cent is high .It is the equivalent of 8 per cent for an unmarried investor with more than $16,000 of income to be taxed , or for a married couple with more than $32,000 of taxed income .Swelling traffic .
A new report on the earnings records of toll roads in the most recent 12-month period -- ending in February or March -- shows what is happening .The report is based on a survey by Blyth & Company , investment bankers .Nearly all the turnpikes show gains in net revenues during the period .And there is the bright note : The gains were achieved in the face of temporary traffic lags late in 1960 and early in 1961 as a result of business recession .Many of the roads also were hit by an unusually severe winter .
Indication : The long-term trend of turnpike traffic is upward .Look , for example , at the Ohio Turnpike .Traffic on that road slumped sharply in January and February , as compared with those same months in 1960 .Then March brought an 18 per cent rise in net revenues -- after operating costs .As a result , the road's net revenues in the 12 months ending March 31 were 186 per cent of the annual interest payments on the turnpike bonds .
That was up from 173 per cent in the preceding 12 months .That same pattern of earnings shows up on the Massachusetts Turnpike .Operating revenues were off in the first three months of 1961 , but up for the 12 months ending in March .Costs were held down , despite a bitter winter .For the year , the road earned 133 per cent of its interest costs , against 121 per cent in the preceding period .
The road's engineers look for further improvement when the turnpike is extended into Boston .Slow successes .Some turnpikes have not been in full operation long enough to prove what they can do .The 187-mile Illinois State Toll Highway , for example , was not opened over its entire length until December , 1958 .In the 12 months ended in February , 1960 , the highway earned enough to cover 64 per cent of its interest load -- with the remainder paid out of initial reserves .
In the 12 months ended in February , 1961 , this highway earned 93 per cent of its interest .That improvement is continuing .In the first two months of 1961 , earnings of the Illinois highway available for interest payments were up 55 per cent from early 1960 .Success , for many turnpikes , has come hard .Traffic frequently has failed to measure up to engineers' rosy estimates .
In these cases , the turnpike managements have had to turn to toll-rate increases , or to costly improvements such as extensions or better connections with other highways .Many rate increases already have been put into effect .Higher tolls are planned for July 1 , 1961 , on the Richmond-Petersburg , Va. , Turnpike , and proposals for increased tolls on the Texas Turnpike are under study .Easier access .Progress is being made , too , in improving motorists' access to many turnpikes .
The Kansas Turnpike offers an illustration .Net earnings of that road rose from 62 per cent of interest requirements in calendar 1957 to 86 per cent in the 12 months ended Feb. 28 , 1961 .Further improvements in earnings of the Kansas Turnpike are expected late in 1961 , with the opening of a new bypass at Wichita , and still later when the turnpike gets downtown connections in both Kansas City , Kans. , and Kansas City , Mo. .Meanwhile , there appears to be enough money in the road's reserve fund to cover the interest deficiency for eight more years .For some roads , troubles .
Investors studying the toll-road bonds for opportunities find that not all roads are nearing their goals .Traffic and revenues on the Chicago Skyway have been a great disappointment to planners and investors alike .If nothing is done , the prospect is that that road will be in default of interest in 1962 .West Virginia toll bonds have defaulted in interest for months , and , despite recent improvement in revenues , holders of the bonds are faced with more of the same .These , however , are exceptions .
The typical picture at this time is one of steady improvement .It's going to take time for investors to learn how many of the toll-road bonds will pay out in full .Already , however , several of the turnpikes are earning enough to cover interest requirements by comfortable margins .Many others are attracting the traffic needed to push revenues up to the break-even point .A top American official , after a look at Europe's factories , thinks the U.S. is in a `` very serious situation '' competitively .
Commerce Secretary Luther Hodges , accompanied by a member of our staff , on May 10 toured plants of two of Italy's biggest companies -- Fiat , the auto producer , and Olivetti , maker of typewriters and calculating machines .Our staff man cabled from Turin as follows --`` Follow Secretary Hodges through the Fiat plant , and you learn this :`` One , modern equipment -- much of it supplied under the Marshall Plan -- enables Fiat to turn out 2,100 cars a day .About half of these are exported .
`` Two , wage costs are a fraction of the U.S. costs .A skilled worker on the assembly line , for example , earns $37 a week .`` Three , labor troubles are infrequent .Fiat officials say they have had no strikes for more than six years .`` Said Secretary Hodges : ' It's a tough combination for the U.S. to face .
`` Olivetti had a special interest for Hodges .Olivetti took over Underwood , the U.S. typewriter maker , in late 1959 .Within a year , without reducing wages , Underwood's production costs were cut one third , prices were slashed .The result has been that exports of Underwood products have doubled .`` The Olivetti plant near Turin has modern layout , modern machinery .
The firm is design-conscious , sales-conscious , advertising-conscious .`` Hodges is trying to get more foreign business to go to the U.S. .The inflow of foreign capital would help the U.S. balance of payments .`` Hodges predicted : ' I think we will see more foreign firms coming to the U.S. .There are many places where we can use their vigor and new ideas ' '' .
Foreign competition has become so severe in certain textiles that Washington is exploring new ways of handling competitive imports .The recently unveiled Kennedy moves to control the international textile market can be significant for American businessmen in many lines .Important aspects of the Kennedy textile plans are these :An international conference of the big textile-importing and textile-exporting countries will be called shortly by President Kennedy .Chief aims of the proposed conference are worth noting .
The U.S. will try to get agreement among the industrialized countries to take more textile imports from the less-developed countries over the years .Point is that developing countries often build up a textile industry first , need encouragement to get on their feet .If they have trouble exporting , international bill for their support will grow larger than it otherwise would .Idea is to let these countries earn their way as much as possible .At the same time , another purpose of the conference will be to get certain low-wage countries to control textile exports -- especially dumping of specific products -- to high-wage textile-producing countries .
Japan , since 1957 , has been `` voluntarily '' curbing exports of textiles to the U.S. .Hong Kong , India and Pakistan have been limiting exports of certain types of textiles to Britain for several years under the `` Lancashire Pact '' .None of these countries is happy with these arrangements .The Japanese want to increase exports to the U.S. While they have been curbing shipments , they have watched Hong Kong step in and capture an expanding share of the big U.S. market .Hong Kong interests loudly protest limiting their exports to Britain , while Spanish and Portuguese textiles pour into British market unrestrictedly .
The Indians and Pakistanis are chafing under similar restrictions on the British market for similar reasons .The Kennedy hope is that , at the conference or through bilateral talks , the low-wage textile-producing countries in Asia and Europe will see that `` dumping '' practices cause friction all around and may result in import quotas .Gradual , controlled expansion of the world's textile trade is what President Kennedy wants .This may point the way toward international stabilization agreements in other products .It's an important clue to Washington thinking .
Note , too , that the Kennedy textile plan looks toward modernization or shrinkage of the U.S. textile industry .`` Get competitive or get out '' .In veiled terms , that's what the Kennedy Administration is saying to the American textile industry .The Government will help in transferring companies and workers into new lines , where modernization doesn't seem feasible .Special depreciation on new textile machinery may be allowed .
Government research will look into new products and methods .Import quotas aren't ruled out where the national interest is involved .But the Kennedy Administration doesn't favor import quotas .Rather , they are impressed with the British Government's success in forcing -- and helping -- the British textile industry to shrink and to change over to other products .What's happening in textiles can be handwriting on the wall for other lines having difficulty competing with imports from low-wage countries .
Among the highest-paid workers in the world are U.S. coal miners .Yet U.S. coal is cheap enough to make foreign steelmakers' mouths water .Steel Company of Wales , a British steelmaker , wants to bring in Virginia coal , cut down on its takings of Welsh coal in order to be able to compete more effectively -- especially in foreign markets .Virginia coal , delivered by ship in Wales , will be about $2.80 a ton cheaper than Welsh coal delivered by rail from nearby mines .U.S. coal is cheap , despite high wages , because of widespread mechanization of mines , wide coal seams , attactive rates on ocean freight .
