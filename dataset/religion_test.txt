For Castro was bringing Cuba not freedom , but hatred .
He spent long hours before the TV spitting out promises of revenge .
He showed us how he dealt with his enemies : he executed them before TV cameras .
On home sets children were watching the death throes of men who were shot before the paredon , the firing wall .
Castro's reforms ? ?
He seemed bent on coupling them with vengeance .
New schools were rising , but with this went a harsh proclamation : any academic degree earned during Batista's regime was invalid .
Economic aid ? ?
He had promised cheaper housing : arbitrarily he cut all rents in half , whether the landlord was a millionaire speculator or a widow whose only income was the rental of a spare room .
Under another law , hundreds of farms were seized .
Farm workers had their wages cut almost in half .
Of this , only 50 cents a day was paid in cash , the rest in script usable only in `` People's Stores '' .
A suspicion was growing that Fidel Castro was a Communist .
In my mind , I began to review : his use of hate to gain support ; ;
his People's Courts ; ;
his division of society into two classes , one the hero , the other the villain .
But most disturbing of all were the advisers he called to sit with him in the Palace ; ;
many came from Communist countries .
What should I do about it , I asked myself ? ?
I had watched Castro handling his enemies before the paredon .
There was no doubt in my mind that if I crossed him , mobs would appear outside our windows shouting `` Paredon ! !
Paredon ! !
''
What should I do ? ?
I was proud of the new buildings which housed Diario now : the rotogravures , gleaming behind glass doors ; ;
the thump and whir of our new presses .
Here was a powerful , ready-made medium , but it could speak only if I told it to .
Then one day , early in January , 1960 , I sat down at my desk , and suddenly I was aware of the crucifix .
It was a simple ivory crucifix which my mother had given me .
I had mounted it on velvet and hung it over my desk to remind me always to use the power of the paper in a Christian manner .
Now it seemed almost as if Jesus were looking down at me with sadness in His eyes , saying :
`` You will lose the paper .
You may lose your life .
But do you have any choice '' ? ?
I knew in that moment that I did not have any choice .
From that day on I began to write editorials about the things I did not think correct in Fidel Castro's regime .
