If your principal place of abode for the tax year is outside the United States ( including Alaska and Hawaii ) , Puerto Rico , or the Virgin Islands and you have no legal residence or principal place of business in any Internal Revenue district in the United States , you should file your return with the Office of International Operations , Internal Revenue Service , Washington 25 , D.C. .Adjusted gross income.The deductions allowed in determining Adjusted Gross Income put all taxpayers on a comparable basis .It is the amount you enter on line 9 , page 1 of Form 1040 .
Some deductions are subtracted from Gross Income to determine Adjusted Gross Income .Other deductions are subtracted only from Adjusted Gross Income in arriving at Taxable Income .To compute your adjusted gross income you total all items of income .( See Chapter 6 .) From this amount deduct the items indicated below .
Businessmen deduct all ordinary and necessary expenses attributable to a trade or business .Rents or royalties .If you hold property for the production of rents or royalties you subtract , in computing Adjusted Gross Income , ordinary and necessary expenses and certain other deductions attributable to the property .( See Chapter 15 .)
Outside salesmen deduct all expenses attributable to earning a salary , commission , or other compensation .( See Chapter 10 .)Employees deduct expenses of travel , meals and lodging while away from home in connection with the performance of their services as employees .They also deduct transportation expenses incurred in connection with the performance of services as employees even though they are not away from home .
( See Chapter 12 .) If your employer reimburses you for expenses incurred , you deduct such expenses if they otherwise qualify .( See Chapter 10 .)Sick pay , if included in your Gross Income , is deducted in arriving at Adjusted Gross Income .
If your sick pay is not included in your Gross Income , you may not deduct it .( See Chapter 9 .) income from estates and trusts .If you are a life tenant , you deduct allowable depreciation and depletion .If you are an income beneficiary of property held in trust or an heir , legatee , or devisee , you may deduct allowable depreciation and depletion , if not deductible by the estate or trust .
Deductible losses on sales or exchanges of property are allowable in determining your Adjusted Gross Income .( See Chapter 20 .) 50% of capital gains .You also deduct 50% of the excess of net long-term capital gains over net short-term capital losses in determining Adjusted Gross Income .( See Chapter 24 .
) other deductions .Certain other deductions are not allowed in determining Adjusted Gross Income .They may be claimed only by itemizing them on page 2 of Form 1040 .These deductions may not be claimed if you elect to use the Standard Deduction or Tax Table .( See Chapters 30 through 37 .
)2 .Minors minors must also file returns if they earn $600 or more during the year .A minor is subject to tax on his own earnings even though his parent may , under local law , have the right to them and might actually have received the money .His income is not required to be included in the return of his parent .
A minor child is allowed A personal exemption of $600 on his own return regardless of how much money he may earn .Exemption also allowed parent .If your child is under 19 or is a student you may also claim an exemption for him if he qualifies as your dependent , even though he earns $600 or more .See Chapter 5 .Example .
Your 16 year old son earned $720 in 1961 .You spent $800 for his support .Since he had gross income of $600 or more , he must file a return in which he may claim an exemption deduction of $600 .Since you contributed more than half of his support , you may also claim an exemption for him on your return .He may get a tax refund .
A minor who has gross income of less than $600 is entitled to a refund if income tax was withheld from his wages .Generally , the refund may be obtained by filing Form 1040A accompanied by the withholding statement ( Form W-2 ) .If he had income other than wages subject to withholding , he may be required to file Form 1040 .See Chapter 1 .If your child works for you , you may deduct reasonable wages you paid to him for services he rendered in your business .
You may deduct these payments even though your child uses the money to purchase his own clothing or other necessities which you are normally obligated to furnish him , and even though you may be entitled to his services .The one- or two-season hunt , of which there have been too many recently , may do more harm than good ; ;for such programs raise hopes of assistance toward achieving excellence in scholarship and the arts which are dashed when the programs are discontinued ; ;and they are dashed , no less , by lack of skill in making selections of men and women for development toward the highest reaches of the mind and spirit .For the making of selections on the basis of excellence requires that any foundation making the selections shall have available the judgments of a corps of advisors whose judgments are known to be good : such judgments can be known to be good only by the records of those selected , by records made subsequent to their selection over considerable periods of time .
The central group of the Foundation's advisors are , at any one period of time , the members of our Advisory Board , consisting , now , of thirty-six men and women .They are chosen by the Foundation's Board of Trustees on the bases of their own first-rate accomplishments in their different fields of scholarship and the arts .Their locations in all parts of the United States , and their locations in the several kinds of educational and research institutions that are the principal homes of our intellectual and artistic strengths also are factors in the Trustees' minds .For this concept of an Advisory Board , ancillary to the Board of Trustees , we are indebted to the late President of Harvard University , A. Lawrence Lowell , a master of the subject of the structure of cultural institutions and their administration .That we had the wit and wisdom to adopt Mr. Lowell's concept and make it the base for our processes of selection is one reason why our selections have been , it may be said truly , pretty uniformly good .
For , in accordance with Mr. Lowell's concept of an advisory board , our selections are made by experienced selectors who give both constancy and consistency to our processes and our choices .And lest we should become too consistent , in the sense of becoming heedless of new fields of scholarship and new points of view in the arts , the Foundation's Board of Trustees maintains a trickle -- not a flow ! !-- of new members through the Advisory Board .Two committees of members of the Advisory Board constitute the committees of selection -- one for the selection of Fellows from Canada , the United States , and the English-speaking Caribbean area and one for the selection of Fellows from the Latin American republics and the Republic of the Philippines .To the members of our Advisory Board , and most specially to its members who constitute our committees of selection , the Foundation is indebted for its successes of choice of Fellows .
We are , as we know , utterly dependent on the quality of advice we get ; ;and quality of advice , added to devotion to the Foundation's purposes and ideals , we do get from our Advisory Board in measures so full that they can be appreciated only by those of us who work here every day .But the facts about our Advisory Board and its members' duties are only one of several sets of facts about the quest for advice , both reliable and imaginative , on which to base our selections of Fellows .For example , the interest of past members of the Foundation's Advisory Board remains such that they place their knowledge and judgments at our disposal much as they had done when they were , formally , members of that Board .And , besides , there are a large number of scholars , artists , composers of music , novelists , poets , essayists , choreographers , lawyers , servants of government , and men of affairs -- hundreds , indeed -- who serve the Foundation well with the advice they give us freely and gratis out of their experience .
To all , the Foundation gives the kind of thanks which are more than thanks : to them we are grateful beyond the possibility of conveying in words how grateful we are .It is a truism of business that no business can be better than its board of directors and its top management .The same is true of every foundation .During the biennium reviewed in this Report , our Board of Trustees named able men , younger than the rest of us , to the Board and to top management to insure future continuance of the first-class administration of the Foundation's affairs :Dr. James Brown Fisk , physicist , President of the Bell Telephone Laboratories , was elected to the Board of Trustees .
He is a member both of the National Academy of Sciences and of the American Philosophical Society ; ;and he has served our country well as a scientific statesman on international commissions .Dr. Gordon N. Ray , Provost , Vice-President and Professor of English in the University of Illinois , was appointed Associate Secretary General .The Trustees of the Foundation appointed Dr. Ray to that position with the stated expectation that he would succeed the present Secretary General upon the latter's eventual retirement .Dr. Ray is a Fellow of the Foundation -- appointed thrice to assist his studies of William Makepeace Thackeray and of H. G. Wells -- and , before his appointment to the Foundation's executive staff , had been given our highest scholarly accolade , appointment to the Advisory Board .
Referring further to the Foundation's officers , Dr. James F. Mathias , for eleven years our discerning colleague as Associate Secretary , was promoted to be Secretary .He is a historian , with the great merit of a historian's long view .Also appointed to the Foundation's staff , as Assistant Secretary , is Mr. J. Kellum Smith , Jr. .Mr. Smith , like the present Secretary General , is a lawyer ; ;and lawyers -- with the great virtues that they are trained to read `` the fine print '' carefully and are able out of professional experience to arrive at imaginative solutions to difficult problems in many fields -- are indispensable even in a foundation office .
The present Secretary General has been the Foundation's principal administrative officer continuously since the Foundation's establishment thirty-five years ago .But even he will not last indefinitely and the above-noted new arrangements are , quite simply , made to assure qualitative continuity in the Foundation's policies and practices .The effective recognition of excellence and its nurture has to be learned and is not learned in a day , nor even in a year .We are not given to lamentations , neither personally nor in these Reports .On the contrary , if this be an apocalyptic era as is commonly said , we see it as an era of opportunity .
For , granting that there are great present-day problems to be solved , these problems make great demands ; ;and by their demanding tend to create resources of men's minds and hearts which problems with easy answers do not bring forth .Of this , examples are legion : Pericles speaking his funeral oration in Ancient Greece's extremity after Thermopylae and making it a testament of freedom ; ;Jefferson writing the Declaration of Independence amid the catastrophes of revolution ; ;Christ preaching the Sermon on the Mount , close to his ultimate sacrifice ; ;
Shakespeare speaking with `` the indescribable gusto of the Elizabethan voice '' -- ; ;Keats's words -- in the days of the Spanish Armada's threats ; ;Isaac Newton , at the age of twenty-three , industriously calculating logarithms `` to two and fifty places '' during the great plague year in England , 1665 ; ;Winston Churchill's Olympian , optimistic and resolute sayings when Britain stood alone against the armed forces of tyranny less than twenty years ago ; ;the present-day explorations of outer space , answering age-old questions of science and philosophy , in the face of possible wars of extinction .
Forsan et haec olim meminisse iuvabit , as the Roman poet , Virgil , declared with much more historical sense than most writers of today .It gives , indeed , cause for rejoicing to remember what many catastrophes of the past produced ; ;and it is to be noted also that confidence should grow from remembering that great men often appeared in the past to turn local catastrophe into future good for all mankind .For example , out of the social evils of the English industrial revolution came the novels of Charles Dickens ; ;and his genius moved his readers to seek solutions of those evils for all Western men -- until today -- , in the industrialized West , these social evils substantially do not exist .
The solutions were not arrived at by any theoreticians of the Karl Marx stripe but by men of government -- lawyers , most of them -- and men of business .These were educated men , who , as Mr. Justice Holmes was fond of saying , formed their inductions out of experience under the burden of responsibility .That is , to put it realistically , they had to run their businesses at a profit , or they had to get the votes to get elected .Nevertheless , they made naught of Marx's prophecy that capitalism would never pay the `` workers '' -- to use Marx's word -- more than a subsistence wage , with the consequence that increased productivity must inevitably find its way into the capitalists' pockets with the result , in turn , that the gap between the rich and the poor would irrevocably widen and the misery of the poor increase .But as all understand who have eyes to see , nothing of the kind has happened ; ;
indeed , the contrary has happened .The gulf between the `` rich '' and the `` poor '' has narrowed , in the industrialized Western world , to the point that the word `` poor '' is hardly applicable .And the reason this could happen is clear : men of government , business men , lawyers and all who concerned themselves with the welfare of their fellow men did not let their concern to run their businesses at a profit restrict the development of freedom and opportunity .Some would say that they were not permitted to run their businesses only for profit ; ;and even putting it that way would not prove that Marx was anything but wrong .
Sir Henry Sumner Maine , a hundred years before Communism was a force to be reckoned with , wrote his brilliant legal generalization , that `` the progress of society is from status to contract '' .The essence of contract is that one is free to make a choice of what one will or will not do .Hence , the condition of freedom is a necessary condition for choice .The greater the range of freedom for individual men , the greater the range of choice ; ;the greater the range of choice , the greater the rate of change .
For change is dependent on the possibilities that individual men glimpse for the future .But when there is not freedom and opportunity to choose , men -- individual men -- must remain in status and society does not , cannot , progress .The eternal truth is that progress -- due , as it always is , to individual creative genius -- is just as dependent on freedom as human life is dependent on the beating of the heart .And lest anybody think that considerations such as these are not germane in a foundation report , let me enlighten them with the truths that , under Communism there would have been no capital with which to endow the Foundation , and that there would not be that individual freedom within which the Fellows might proceed , untrammeled in every way , toward their discoveries , their creative efforts for the good of mankind .During the year 1959 , we granted 354 Fellowships ; ;
in 1960 , we granted 334 .As heretofore , our Fellowships are available to assist research in all fields of knowledge and creative effort in all the arts .We do not favor one field over another : we think that all inquiry , all scholarly and artistic creation , is good -- provided only that it contributes to a sense and understanding of the true ends of life , as all first-rate scholarship and artistic creation does .Indeed , if pressed , we would say what the late Robert Henri , American painter , said to a pupil , `` Anything will do for a subject : it's what you do with it that counts '' .Thus , we have no part , and want none , in current discussions of the relative importance of science , the social studies , the humanities , the creative arts .
We want no part in such discussions , because we think them largely futile ; ;and we think them largely futile because , for true excellence of accomplishment , every scholar and every artist must cross boundaries of knowledge and boundaries of points of view .When the Brown & Sharpe Manufacturing Company reached its 125th year as a going industrial concern during 1958 , it became an almost unique institution in the mechanical world .With its history standing astride all but the very beginnings of the industrial revolution , Brown & Sharpe has become over the years a singular monument to the mechanical foresight of its founder , Joseph R. Brown , and a world-renowned synonym for precision and progress in metalworking technology .Joseph R. Brown grew up in the bustle and enterprise of New England between 1810 and 1830 .
He was early exposed to the mechanical world , and in his youth often helped his father , David Brown , master clock and watchmaker , as he plied his trade .At the age of 17 he became an apprentice machinist at the shop of Walcott & Harris in Valley Falls , Rhode Island , and following two or three other jobs in quick succession after graduation , he went into business for himself in 1831 , making lathes and small tools .This enterprise led to a father-and-son combination beginning in 1833 , under the name D. Brown & Son , a business which eventually grew into the modern corporation we now call Brown & Sharpe .The years of Joseph's partnership with his father were numbered .In 1838 , a devastating fire gutted their small shop and soon thereafter David Brown moved west to Illinois , settling on a land grant in his declining years .
Joseph Brown continued in business by himself , quickly rebuilding the establishment which had been lost in the fire and beginning those first steps which were to establish him as a pioneer in raising the standards of accuracy of machine shop practice throughout the world .Much of his genius , of course , sprang from his familiarity with clock movements .During these early years the repair of watches and clocks and the building of special clocks for church steeples formed an important part of the young man's occupation .He became particularly interested in graduating and precision measurement during the 1840's , and his thinking along these lines developed considerably during this period .But his business also grew , and we are told that Mr. Brown found it increasingly difficult to devote as much time to his creative thinking as his inclinations led him to desire .
It must have been with some pleasure and relief that on September 12 , 1848 , Joseph Brown made the momentous entry in his job book , in his characteristically cryptic style , `` Lucian Sharpe came to work for me this day as an apprentice '' .The young apprentice apparently did well by Mr. Brown , for in the third year of his apprenticeship Lucian was offered a full partnership in the firm ; ;the company became `` J. R. Brown & Sharpe '' , and entered into a new and important period of its development .Mr. Sharpe's arrival in the business did indeed provide what Mr. Brown had most coveted -- time for `` tinkering '' , and the opportunity of carrying out in the back room those developments in precision graduation which most interested him at that time .By 1853 , the new partnership announced the precision vernier caliper as the first fruit of their joint efforts .
The basic significance of this invention helped them to follow it rapidly in 1855 by the development of a unique precision gear cutting and dividing engine .That development , in turn , formed the foundation of still more significant expansions in later years -- in gear cutting , in circular graduating , in index drilling , and in many other fields where accuracy was a paramount requirement .Throughout their careers , both Mr. Brown and Mr. Sharpe were interested in the problem of setting up standards of measurement for the mechanical trades .Several efforts were made in this direction , and though not all of them survive to this day , the Brown & Sharpe wire gage system was eventually adopted as the American standard and is still in common use today .As one development followed another , the company's reputation for precision in the graduating field brought it broader and broader opportunities for expansion in precision manufacture .
In 1858 , the partnership began manufacturing the Willcox & Gibbs sewing machine .As the story goes , Mr. Gibbs , who originally came from the back counties of the Commonwealth of Virginia , saw an illustration in a magazine of the famous Howe sewing machine .Curious as to what made it work , he built a crude model of it in wood , and filed a piece of steel until he succeeded in making a metal pickup for the thread , enabling the crude machine to take stitches .When he showed this model as his `` solution '' as to how the Howe sewing machine operated , he was told he was `` wrong '' , and discovered to his amazement that the Howe Machine , which was unknown to him in detail , used two threads while the one that he had perfected used only one .Thus was invented the single thread sewing machine , which Mr. Gibbs in partnership with Mr. Willcox decided to bring to Brown & Sharpe with the proposal that the small company undertake its manufacture .
The new work was a boon to the partnership , not only for its own value but particularly for the stimulation it provided to the imagination of J. R. Brown toward yet further developments for production equipment .The turret screw machine , now known as the Brown & Sharpe hand screw machine , takes its ancestry directly from Mr. Brown's efforts to introduce equipment to simplify the manufacture of the sewing machine .Mr. Brown made important additions to the arts in screw machine design by drastically improving the means for revolving the turret , by introducing automatic feeding devices for the stock , and reversible tap and die holders .In 1861 , Mr. Brown's attention was called to yet another basic production problem -- the manufacture of twist drills .At that time , during the Civil War , Union muskets were being manufactured in Providence and the drills to drill them were being hand-filed with rattail files .
This process neither satisfied the urgent production schedules nor Mr. Brown's imagination of the possibilities in the situation .The child of this problem was Mr. Brown's famous Serial No. 1 Universal Milling Machine , the archtype from which is descended today's universal knee-type milling machine used throughout the world .The original machine , bearing its famous serial number , is still on exhibition at the Brown & Sharpe Precision Center in Providence .During the Civil War period Mr. Brown also invented the Brown & Sharpe formed tooth gear cutter , a basic invention which ultimately revolutionized the world's gear manufacturing industry by changing its basic economics .Up until that time it had been possible to make cutters for making gear teeth , but they were good for only one sharpening .
As soon as the time came for re-sharpening , the precise form of the gear tooth was lost and a new cutter had to be made .This process made the economical manufacture of gears questionable until some way could be found to permit the repeated re-sharpening of gear tooth cutters without the loss of the precision form .Mr. Brown's invention achieved this and , as a byproduct , formed the cornerstone of Brown & Sharpe's position of leadership in the gear making equipment field which lasted until the 1920's when superceded by other methods .The micrometer caliper , as a common workshop tool , also owes much to J. R. Brown .Although Mr. Brown was not himself its inventor ( it was a French idea ) , it is typical that his intuition first conceived the importance of mass producing this basic tool for general use .
So it was that when Mr. Brown and Mr. Sharpe first saw the French tool on exhibition in Paris in 1868 , they brought a sample with them to the United States and started Brown & Sharpe in yet another field where it retains its leadership to this day .The final achievement of Mr. Brown's long and interesting mechanical career runs a close second in importance to his development of the universal milling machine .That achievement was his creation of the universal grinding machine , which made its appearance in 1876 at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition .This machine , like its milling counterpart , was the antecedent of a machine-family used to this very day in precision metalworking shops throughout the world .Along with J. R. Brown's other major developments , the universal grinding machine was profoundly influential in setting the course of Brown & Sharpe for many years to come .
Following Mr. Brown's death , there came forward in the Brown & Sharpe organization many other men who contributed greatly to the development of the company .One such man was Samuel Darling .As head of the firm Darling & Swartz , Mr. Darling began by challenging Brown & Sharpe to its keenest competition during the 1850's and early 60's .In 1868 , however , a truce was called between the companies , and the partnership of Darling , Brown & Sharpe was formed .Between that year and the buying out of Mr. Darling's interest in 1892 , a large portion of the company's precision tool business was carried out under the name of Darling , Brown & Sharpe , and to this day many old precision tools are in use still bearing that famous trademark .
Perhaps the outstanding standard bearer of Mr. Brown's tradition for accuracy was Mr. Oscar J. Beale , whose mechanical genius closely paralleled that of Mr. Brown , and whose particular forte was the development of the exceedingly accurate measuring machinery that enabled Brown & Sharpe to manufacture gages , and therefore its products , with an accuracy exceeding anything then available elsewhere in the world .Also important on the Brown & Sharpe scene , at the turn of the century , was Mr. Richmond Viall , Works Superintendent of the company from 1876 to 1910 .Mr. Viall possessed remarkable talents for the leadership and development of men .He was an ardent champion of the Brown & Sharpe Apprentice Program and personal counselor to countless able men who first developed their industrial talents with the company .In one sense it can be said that one of the most important Brown & Sharpe products over the years has been the men who began work with the company and subsequently came to places of industrial eminence throughout the nation and even abroad .
Commencing with the death of Lucian Sharpe in 1899 , the name of Henry D. Sharpe was for more than 50 years closely interwoven with the destiny of the company .During his presidency , the company's physical plant was enormously expanded , and the length and breadth of the Brown & Sharpe machine tool line became the greatest in the world .During the early part of this century , the Brown & Sharpe works in Providence were unchallenged as the largest single manufacturing facility devoted exclusively to precision machinery and tool manufacture anywhere in the world .During these years the company's product line followed the basic tenets laid down by Mr. Brown .It expanded from hand screw machines to automatic screw machines , from simple formed-tooth gear cutting machines to gear hobbing machines and a large contract gear manufacturing business , from rudimentary belt-driven universal milling machines to a broad line of elaborately controlled knee-type and manufacturing type milling machines .
In the grinding machine field , expansion went far from universal grinders alone and took in cylindrical grinders , surface grinders , and a wide variety of special and semi-special models .In 1951 , Henry D. Sharpe , Jr. succeeded his father and continued the company's development as a major factor in the metal-working equipment business .The company is still broadening its line and is now active on four major fronts .The Machine Tool Division is currently producing Brown & Sharpe single spindle automatic screw machines , grinding machines of many types , and knee and bed-type milling machines .Recently added is the Brown & Sharpe turret drilling machine which introduces the company to an entirely new field of tool development .
In the Industrial Products Division , the company manufactures and markets a wide line of precision gaging and inspection equipment , machinists' tools -- including micrometers , Vernier calipers , and accessories .In the Cutting Tool Division , the principal products include a wide variety of high speed steel milling cutters , end mills and saws .Sales and net income for the year ended December 31 , 1960 showed an improvement over 1959 .Net income was $2,557,111 , or $3.11 per share on 821,220 common shares currently outstanding , as compared to $2,323,867 or $2.82 per share in 1959 , adjusted to the same number of shares .Sales and other operating income increased 25.1% from $24,926,615 in 1959 to $31,179,816 in 1960 .
This increase was sufficient to overcome the effect on net income of higher costs of manufacture and increased expenditures on research and development .In spite of the fact that our largest market , the textile industry , was affected substantially by the current decline in business activity , we have been able to produce and deliver our machines throughout the year 1960 at a rate materially higher than during 1959 .Outlook for current yearOur current rate of incoming orders has now contracted and unless this trend can be reversed , our production for 1961 will be lower than for 1960 .However , the healthy inventory position of the textile industry lends support to the broadly expressed belief that improvement in that industry can be expected by the second half of 1961 .
Need for sound tax policyIn connection with our continuing development of new and more efficient mill machinery , a sounder U. S. income tax policy on depreciation of production equipment , enabling the mills to charge off the cost of new machines on a more realistic basis , could , if adopted , have favorable effects on Leesona's business in the next few years .Such a depreciation policy would also , we believe , prove a very important factor in strengthening the competitive position of the U. S. textile and other industries , thus helping to strengthen the position of the dollar in foreign exchange .Research and developmentOur research and development program , serving as it does an industry which must compete against low-cost production throughout the world , continues to have primary emphasis at Leesona .
This program is based on the policy of designing and building efficient machines which will help produce better textile values -- fabrics whose cost in relation to quality , fashion and utility provide the consumer with better textile products for the money .Such policy involves continuing effort to improve on existing mill equipment , in terms of efficiency and versatility .But more important , we believe , it must concentrate on the development of entirely new concepts in textile processing as do the Unifil loom winder and our more recent Uniconer automatic coning machine .Budget increasedOn this basis , our already substantial budget for research and development has been further increased in recent years in order to finance the continuing engineering and design work essential to Leesona's future growth in sales and earnings .
Much of this necessary increase in research and development , though properly chargeable to current expenses , is not reflected in earnings until projects are completed and the new machines sold in quantity , usually over a period of several years .Stretch yarn machinesIn December we began to ship our ultra-high-speed stretch yarn machines .These machines produce the higher quality stretch yarns required in weaving stretch and textured fabrics .During the past year , great progress has been made by the weaving mills in creating new stretch and textured fabrics .
Fashion centers are now predicting broad acceptance of sports apparel and improved `` wash and wear '' dresses and blouses made from these fabrics .This machine , operating at speeds up to 350,000 revolutions per minute , is believed to provide one of the fastest mechanical operations in industry today .It transfers yarn directly from the producers' largest package into ideal supply packages for use on Unifil loom winders in weaving stretch yarn fabrics .Large-package twisterOur new large-package ring twister for glass fiber yarns is performing well in our customers' mills .
Later in the year , additional types of this Leesona twister will be made available to mills for other man-made fibers and natural yarns .These machines are designed to provide higher operating speeds , larger yarn packages , and greater flexibility of application to different types of yarn .This we believe will substantially broaden the potential market for the equipment .UniconerMajor activity at Providence in 1961 will involve the scheduled completion of tooling for production of the Uniconer automatic coning machine .
This work is progressing on schedule and we expect to make initial shipments in the fourth quarter of this year .This machine was demonstrated in two textile machinery exhibitions last year and was well received by the industry .The potential market for the machine should be comparable to that of the Unifil loom winder .The Uniconer has several outstanding features -- it operates with much greater efficiency than existing equipment ; ;it incorporates an automatic knot-tying device on each spindle , and it will knot a break in the yarn in 10 seconds as well as tie in new bobbins as the running end is exhausted .
Because the bobbin-to-cone winding process is a relatively high-cost operation for the mill , the almost complete automation provided by the Uniconer can mean important economies in textile production , at the same time upgrading quality .Many mills have already placed firm orders for this machine .New Unifil applicationA new application for the Unifil loom winder , running single filling for box looms , will broaden mill use of this equipment .Take-up machines
A new spinning take-up machine has been developed to facilitate the use of our take-up machine in the production of thermoplastic yarns .It is equipped with electronic controls that can be set to hold precise tension and speed .This new machine takes up filament yarn from spinneret or extruder and winds large packages at speeds up to 6,000 feet per minute .It is equipped with an automatic threading device to reduce waste and handling time .Our take-up machines and our twister-coners are undergoing important pilot plant testing for application with new high polymer yarns , in several fiber producing plants .
We look forward to a stronger position in this expanding field .Diversification plansWe are interested in further diversification into other fields of capital goods , or components for industrial products , and have recently intensified our efforts in that direction .Patterson Moos researchOur Patterson Moos Research Division has made further very encouraging progress in development of fuel cells .
The cooperation of our exclusive American licensee , Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Division of United Aircraft Corporation , has been important in this work .In addition to its major effort on fuel cells , Patterson Moos Research Division is continuing to carry on research in other fields , both under contract for the Defense Department , other government agencies and for our own account .PMR is currently supplying components vital to the Titan and Minuteman programs .We have recently entered into an agreement with Compagnie Generale De Telegraphie Sans Fil ( CSF ) of France for the exclusive exchange of technical information on thermoelectric materials .The agreement gives us rights for manufacturing and marketing of such materials in the United States .
Initially we will import the thermoelectric materials and modules from France but later we will manufacture in this country .There is a rapidly growing demand for this material , primarily from the military .Further research , we believe , will develop important commercial applications .A project for the Air Force has been completed in which the NAIR infrared detecting device was developed for area monitoring of noxious or dangerous gases .We are initiating research on the use of solid state materials for infrared detection using a method which will not require cooling of materials to attain high sensitivity .
The rapid advance in science today suggests many other avenues of investigation .Our plan is to keep abreast of these advances , and select for development those fields which seem most promising for our special capabilities .New plant facilitiesEarly in August we broke ground for a new $3,500,000 plant in Warwick , Rhode Island , which will house our textile and coil winding machinery operations .Construction is well along , and the plant is scheduled for completion in November of this year .
All operations now carried on at our plant at Cranston will be transferred to Warwick .Operations in the new plant should be producing efficiently early in 1962 .An architect's sketch of the new plant is shown on the front cover .The building will contain 430,000 square feet , approximately the same as our present plant .However , its modern one-story layout is designed to increase our production capacity , permit more efficient manufacturing , and substantially reduce current repair and maintenance costs .
A major consideration in the choice of the Warwick site , four miles from Cranston , was the fact that it permits retention of our present trained and highly skilled work force .We have entered into an agreement for the sale of the present Cranston properties , effective as soon as we have completed removal to our new plant .British subsidiaryDuring the year our British subsidiary , Leesona-Holt , Limited , expanded its plant in Darwen , England , and added machine tool capacity .The operations of its other plant in Rochdale and Leesona's former operations in Manchester were transferred to a recently acquired plant in the adjoining town of Heywood .
Layout and equipment were modernized and improved to obtain increased production on an efficient basis .The area available at Heywood is approximately three times the size of the former Rochdale and Manchester locations .In addition , land has been purchased to permit doubling the size of the plant in the future .Financial developmentsThe new Warwick plant is being built at our expense and under our direction .
It will be transfered on completion to The Industrial Foundation of Rhode Island , a non-profit organization , which will reimburse us for the cost of construction .We will then occupy the new plant under lease , with an option to purchase .These arrangements are , in our opinion , very favorable to Leesona .Interim financing of construction costs is provided by a short term loan from The Chase Manhattan Bank .In addition to expenditures on the Warwick plant , we have invested approximately $1,961,000 for machinery and equipment at Cranston , and for new machinery , plant and equipment at Leesona-Holt , Limited .
We believe that these improved facilities will contribute income and effect savings which will fully justify the investment .Long term loans have been reduced by $395,000 to $2,461,000 .Inventories increased $625,561 to $8,313,514 during the year and should decline in coming months .Thus we enter 1961 in a strong financial position .Employee contracts
In accordance with the two-year contract signed in May , 1959 , with the International Association of Machinists , AFL-CIO , wages of hourly employees were increased by 4% in May , 1960 , and pay levels for non-exempt salaried employees were increased proportionately .In addition , Blue Cross coverage for all employees and their dependents was extended to provide the full cost of semi-private hospital accommodations .Personnel benefitsIn addition to direct salaries and wages , the Company paid or accrued during the year the following amounts for the benefit of employees :During the pension year ended December 31 , 1960 , 23 employees retired , making a total of 171 currently retired under the Company's pension plan .
At December 13 , 1960 the fund held by the Industrial National Bank of Providence , as trustee for payment of past and future service pensions to qualified members of the plan , totaled $2,412,616 .The basic market for textiles is growing with the expansion of the population that began 20 years ago .Another growth factor is increased consumer demand for better quality and larger quantities of fabrics that go with a rising standard of living .As in many other industries , rising costs and intense competition , both domestic and foreign , have exerted increasing pressure on earnings of the textile industry in recent years .Increased efficiency
In textiles , as elsewhere , a major part of the solution lies in greater efficiency and higher productivity .As a designer and manufacturer of textile production machinery , Leesona and other companies in its industry have sought to meet this challenge with new or improved equipment and methods that would increase production , yet maintain both quality and flexibility .Problems of shifting stylesThe problem of efficient production in textiles is complicated by the fact that the industry serves large markets which shift quickly with changes of fashion in apparel or home decoration .Production must be adjusted accordingly , at minimum cost and quickly .
In addition , production machinery must in many cases be designed to handle with equal efficiency both natural fibers and the increasing number of synthetics , as well as blends .Following the term of service in Japan , each emissary returns for a brief visit to the campus to interpret his experience to the college community .The Carleton Service Fund provides the financial support for this program .Musical activitiesthe college was one of the first to recognize the importance of music not only as a definite part of the curriculum but as a vital adjunct to campus life .
Extensive facilities for group performance are provided by maintaining , under skilled direction , the Choir , the Orchestra , the Band , the Glee Club , and smaller ensembles of wind and string players .All students are invited to participate in any of the musical organizations for which they qualify .Orchestra , Band , and Choir have auditions during the week preceding the first day of classes .The Glee Club is open to all students and faculty with no auditions necessary for membership .In addition to the many appearances of these organizations throughout the college year , there are concerts by students of the music department , by members of the music faculty , and by visiting artists .
Student musical organizations are the Knights of Carleton and the Overtones ( men's vocal groups ) , and the Keynotes ( a women's singing group ) .These student-directed organizations include eight to ten members each ; ;they perform at many campus social events .Religious activitiesfrom the founding of the College those responsible for its management have planned to provide its students favorable conditions for personal religious development and to offer opportunities through the curriculum and otherwise for understanding the meaning and importance of religion .
Courses are offered in ethics , the philosophy and history of religion , Christian thought and history , and the Bible .Carleton aims throughout its entire teaching program to represent a point of view and a spirit which will contribute to the moral and religious development of its students .A college service of worship is held each Sunday morning at eleven o'clock in the Chapel .The sermons are given by the College Chaplain , by members of the faculty , or by guest preachers .Music is furnished by the Carleton College Choir .
Chapel services are held weekly .These services at which attendance is voluntary are led by the Chaplain , by the President of the College , by selected faculty members , students , and visitors .The service is brief and variety in forms of worship is practiced .A Sunday evening program provides theological lectures , music , drama , and films related to the issues of the Judeo-Christian tradition .Attendance is required at the College Service of Worship or at the Sunday Evening Program or at any regularly organized service of public worship .
Each semester every student must attend ten of the services or religious meetings .Attendance at the Chapel Service is voluntary .Religious organizations include the groups described below .The Y.M.C.A. and Y.W.C.A. at Carleton are connected with the corresponding national organizations and carry out their general purposes .Occasional meetings are held for the whole membership , usually with a guest speaker , while smaller discussion groups meet more frequently .
The Associations sponsor many traditional campus events and provide students with opportunities to form new friendships , to broaden their interests , and to engage in worthwhile service projects .There are other organizations representing several of the denominational groups .Included are the following : Baptist Student Movement , Canterbury Club ( Episcopal ) , Christian Science Organization , Friends' Meeting for Worship , Hillel ( Jewish ) , Liberal Religious Fellowship , Lutheran Student Association , Newman Club ( Roman Catholic ) , Presbyterian Student Fellowship , United Student Fellowship ( Congregational-Baptist ) , and Wesley Fellowship ( Methodist ) .Student religious organizations are co-ordinated under the Religious Activities Committee , a standing committee of the Carleton Student Association .The Northfield churches include the following : Alliance , Congregational-Baptist , Episcopal , Lutheran ( Norwegian , Danish , Missouri Synod , and Bethel ) , Methodist , Moravian , Pentecostal , and Roman Catholic .
Theaterthe purpose of producing plays at the College is three-fold : to provide the Carleton students with the best possible opportunity for theater-going within the limits set by the maturity and experience of the performers and the theatrical facilities available ; ;to encourage the practice of attending the theater ; ;and to develop a discriminating audience for good drama and sensitive performance .Dramatic activity at the College is organized and carried on by The Carleton Players , which is to say by all students who are so inclined to advance these aims .
For the 1960-1961 season , The Carleton Players have announced Blood Wedding by Federico Garcia Lorca , The Knight Of The Burning Pestle by Beaumont and Fletcher and A Moon For The Misbegotten by Eugene O'Neill , with a pre-season production of The Glass Menagerie by Tennessee Williams .Student workshopthis workshop , located in Boliou Hall , provides facilities for students to work in ceramics , weaving , enameling , welding , woodworking , textile printing , printmaking , and lapidary .These extra-curricular activities are conducted under supervision of the Director of the Student Workshop .The workshop is open five afternoons and two evenings each week .
A student organization , Bottega , is open to any student interested in increasing his understanding and appreciation of the graphic and ceramic arts in their historical , technical , and productive contexts .The group meets once a week in the Boliou Student Workshop .They are assisted and advised by members of the Art Department .Athleticsthe Athletic program at Carleton is considered an integral part of the activities of the College and operates under the same budgetary procedure and controls as the academic work .
The physical education program for men recognizes the value of participation in competitive sports in the development of the individual student and aims to give every man an opportunity to enter some form of athletic competition , either intercollegiate or intramural .The same standards for admission , for eligibility to receive scholarships or grants-in-aid , and for scholastic performance at college apply to all students .A faculty committee on athletics , responsible to the faculty as a whole , exercises control over the athletic program of the College .It concerns itself with : 1 .The policies which govern the program 2 .
The preservation of desirable balance between the athletic and academic programs of the College 3 .The approval of athletic schedules 4 .The maintenance of Midwest Conference eligibility standardsCarleton is a member of the Midwest Collegiate Athletic Conference and abides by its eligibility rules .In addition to these rules , Carleton has added the following : 1 .
A student who while in attendance at Carleton College participates in an athletic contest during the school year , other than that sponsored by the College , shall be permanently ineligible to participate in intercollegiate athletics at Carleton College and will also face permanent suspension from the institution .The school year does not end for any student until he has completed his last examination of the semester .2 .A student to be eligible for the captaincy of any Carleton team must have a scholastic record of at least 1.00 .The `` C '' club is composed of the men of the College who have won an official letter in Carleton athletics .
The purpose of the Club is to promote better athletic teams at Carleton and to increase interest in them among the student body .This is done by encouraging the entire male student body to participate in either the intercollegiate or intramural sports program and by sponsoring the Carleton cheerleaders .Soccer Club .The Soccer Club was organized by undergraduate men interested in playing soccer and promoting the sport .Membership consists of both beginners and experienced players .
Practices are held regularly and the schedule of games is prepared by the student coach and the officers of the club .Women's Recreation Association .This Association , organized in 1920 , is affiliated with the Athletic Federation of College Women .The purpose of the organization is to further the interest of women students in recreational activities as a means of promoting physical efficiency , sportsmanship , and `` play for play's sake '' .The Association is governed by a board made up of representatives from each of the four classes .
Membership is open to any woman student in the College .Active groups sponsored by the organization include the Saddle Club , Orchesis , Golf Club , Tennis Club , and Dolphins .The Saddle Club , open to students proficient in horsemanship , presents the Annual Spring Riding Exhibition , and during the year it offers speakers , movies , breakfast rides , and trips to broaden their knowledge of the sport .Orchesis , for students interested in the modern dance , contributes to the May Fete and offers earlier in the year a modern dance demonstration .Tennis Club participates in a dual tennis tournament with the University of Minnesota each fall , and also sponsors a two-day state invitational tennis meet at Carleton in May .
The Dolphins present a three-night water show the week of the May Fete .Under the auspices of the Women's Recreation Association , interclass competition is organized in badminton , basketball , field hockey , golf , tennis , and swimming .The Association participates in the winter sports carnival and sponsors several Play Days with St. Olaf and other nearby colleges .With the co-operation of the Department of Physical Education for Men , the Women's Recreation Association arranges mixed tournaments in tennis and golf in the fall and spring .Throughout the year there are social events , such as picnics , breakfast hikes , canoe trips , banquets , and indoor parties .
College publicationsin addition to the miscellaneous pamphlets and other printed matter which it issues , the College maintains regular publications , as follows :The Bulletin , in five issues : The Report Of The President in August ; ;The Alumni Fund Report in September ; ;the Annual Catalog in March ; ;
an Alumni Reunion Bulletin in April ; ;and a special Bulletin in June .The College also publishes each year The Report Of The Treasurer and a monthly newsletter entitled Carleton College Comments .In co-operation with the Alumni Association of Carleton College , an alumni magazine , The Voice Of The Carleton Alumni , is edited and mailed seven times a year by the College's Publications Office and the Alumni Office .At intervals an alumni directory is issued .
These publications may be secured as follows : The Annual Catalog from the Director of Admissions and other issues from the Publications Office .In January , 1960 , the first issue of The Carleton Miscellany , a quarterly literary magazine , was published by the College .The magazine , edited by members of the Carleton Department of English , includes contributions by authors from both within and beyond the Carleton community .Student publicationsThe Carletonian , the college newspaper , is edited by students and published by the College under the supervision of the Publications Board .
( See page 100 .) It is issued weekly throughout the college year .The Publications Board holds annual competitive examinations for places on the editorial and business staffs .The editor , sports editor , and student business manager are chosen in December , the new staff assuming responsibility for the paper at the beginning of the second semester .The paper affords excellent practice for students interested in the field of journalism .
The Algol , the college annual , is published in the fall of each year .The Algol serves as a record of campus organizations and student activities during the year .The Publications Board receives applications for the positions of editor and business manager and makes the appointments in the spring previous to the year of publication .Members of The Algol staff are nominated by the editor and business manager and appointed by the Publications Board .Manuscript , a quarterly literary magazine , is published by the students of the College .
It is the purpose of this magazine to serve as an outlet for student creative writing .The editor and business manager of Manuscript are appointed by the Publications Board .Campus broadcasting stationA low-power , `` carrier-current '' broadcasting station , KARL , heard only in the campus dormitories , is owned and operated by the students to provide an outlet for student dramatic , musical , literary , technical , and other talents , and to furnish information , music , and entertainment for campus listeners .Over a hundred students participate in the planning and production of the daily program schedule .
KARL provides experience for students who wish to pursue careers in radio .Student governmentthe Carleton Student Association includes all students in college and is intended `` to work for the betterment of Carleton College by providing student government and student participation with the college administration in the formulation and execution of policies which pertain to student life and activities '' .The Carleton Social Co-operative is a standing committee of the Carleton Student Association .Week-end activities for the entire campus are planned by the Co-op Board .
In recent months , much attention has been given to the probable extent of the current downtrend in business and economists are somewhat divided as to the outlook for the near future .And yet , despite some disappointment with the performance of this first year of the new decade , 1960 has been a good year in many ways , with many overall measures of business having reached new peaks for the year as a whole .The shift in sentiment from excessive optimism early in the year to the present mood of caution has probably been a good thing , in that it has prevented the accumulation of the burdensome inventories that have characterized many previous swings in the business cycle .This caution has been particularly noticeable in a tendency of retailers and distributors to shift the inventory burden back on the supplier , and the fact stocks at retail are low in many lines has escaped attention because of the presence of higher stocks at the manufacturing level .In the electronics industry , this tendency is well illustrated by inventories of TV sets .
Factory stocks in recent months have been the highest they have been in three years , while those at retail are below 1959 .The total value of our industry's shipments , at factory prices , increased from $9.2 billion in 1959 to approximately $10.1 billion as a result of increases in all of the major segments of our business -- home entertainment , military , industrial , and replacement .I believe a further gain is in prospect for 1961 .Home entertainment sales upReflecting the largest percentage of high-end sets such as consoles and combinations since 1953 , dollar value of home entertainment electronics in 1960 was about $1.9 billion , compared to $1.7 billion in 1959 .
Sales of TV sets at retail ran ahead of the like months of 1959 through July ; ;set production ( excluding those destined for the export market ) also ran ahead in the early months , but was curtailed after the usual vacation shutdowns in the face of growing evidence that some of the early production plans had been overly optimistic .For the year as a whole , retail sales of TV sets probably came to 5.8 million against 5.7 million in 1959 ; ;however , production came to only 5.6 million compared to 6.2 million .In contrast to the lower turnout of TV , total radio production increased from 15.4 million sets to 16.7 million ( excluding export ) .
Both home and auto radios were in excellent demand , with retail sales of home sets ahead of 1959 in every month of the first eleven ; ;sales and production of home sets were about equal at 10.4 million units .Auto set production came to about 6.3 million compared to 5.6 million in 1959 .Separate phonographs also had a good year , reflecting the growing popularity of stereo sound and the same tendency on the part of the consumer to upgrade that characterized the radio-TV market .The outlook for entertainment electronics in 1961 is certainly far from clear at present , but recent surveys have shown a desire on the part of consumers to step up their buying plans for durable goods .
I would expect that sales at retail in the first half of 1961 might be below 1960 by some 10 - 15% but that second-half levels should show a favorable comparison , with a possibility of quite strong demand late in the year if business conditions recover as some recent forecasts suggest they will .I look for TV sales and production to be approximately equal at 5.7 million sets for the year , but I look for some decline in radios from the high rate in 1961 to more nearly the 1959 level of 15.0 - 15.5 million sets .I therefore believe it is realistic to assume a modest drop in the total value of home entertainment electronics to about $1.8 million , slightly below 1960 , but above 1959 .Military electronics to grow1960 witnessed another substantial increase in our industry's shipments of military electronics , which totalled about $5.4 billion compared to $4.9 billion in 1959 .
It is interesting to note that the present level of military electronics procurement is greater than the industry's total sales to all markets in 1950-1953 , which were good years for our industry with television enjoying its initial period of rapid consumer acceptance .It has been correctly pointed out by well-informed people in the industry that it is probably unrealistic to expect a continuation of the yearly growth of 15% or better that characterized the decade of the 1950's , and that our military markets may be entering upon a new phase in which procurement of multiple weapons systems will give way to concentration of still undeveloped areas of our defense capability .While this may well be true in general , I believe it is also important to keep in mind that some recent developments suggest that over the next year or so military electronics may be one of the most strongly growing areas in an economy which is not expanding rapidly in other directions .Among the items scheduled for acceleration in the near future are the Polaris and B70 programs , strengthening of the airborne alert system of the Strategic Air Command , and improved battlefield surveillance systems .Research and development expenditures connected with the reconnaissance satellite SAMOS and the future development of ballistic missile defense systems such as Nike-Zeus are expected to increase substantially .
Research , development test and evaluation funds , devoted to missiles in 1960 were 3 to 4 times as large as those devoted to aircraft , and actual missile procurement is expected to exceed aircraft procurement by 1963 .Still later , the realm of space technology will show substantial gains ; ;it has been estimated that spending by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration will rise from less than $500 million in fiscal 1960 to more than $2 billion by 1967 , and that the electronic industry's share of these expenditures will be closer to 50% than the current 20% .The stepped-up defense procurement called for in the 1961 Budget has already begun to make itself felt in an upturn in orders for military electronic equipment and the components that go into it , and it has been suggested that an additional $2 billion increase in total defense spending may be requested for fiscal 1962 .Although the impact of these increases on our industry's shipments will be gradual , on balance I look for another good increase in shipments in the coming year , to at least $6 billion .
Industrial electronic equipmentPaced by the continuing rapid growth of electronic data processing , sales of industrial and commercial electronic equipment totalled $1.8 billion compared to $1.6 billion in 1959 .The market for computers and other data-handling continues to expand at the rate of about 30% annually , reaching some $450 million in 1960 .Informed estimates look for this market to approximately quadruple by the late 1960's , under the stimulus of new applications in the fields of banking and retailing , industrial process control , and information storage and retrieval .In the industrial field , prospects for higher expenditures on electronic testing and measuring equipment are also quite bright .
For the near term , however , it must be realized that the industrial and commercial market is somewhat more sensitive to general business conditions than is the military market , and for this reason I would expect that any gain in 1961 may be somewhat smaller than those of recent years ; ;sales should slightly exceed 1960 , however , and reach $1.9 billion .Replacement partsIn addition to the three major original equipment segments of the electronics business , the steady growth in the market for replacement parts continues year by year .This is now a $1.0 billion business , up from $0.9 billion in 1959 , and should reach $1.1 billion in 1961 .
The markets for electronic parts in 1960 have reflected the changing patterns of the various end equipment segments of the industry .Demand for parts for home entertainment was strong in the first half , but purchases were cut back to lower levels during the fall as set manufacturers reduced their own operating rates .In the military field , incoming orders turned down early in the year , and remained rather slow until late fall when the upturn in procurement of equipment began to make itself felt in rising orders for components .Sales of transistors in 1960 exceeded $300 million , compared to $222 million in 1959 despite substantial price reductions in virtually all types .Production totalled about 123 million units against 82 million in 1959 , and I look for a further gain to 188 million units worth approximately $380 million in 1961 .
Sales of passive components , such as capacitors and resistors , although not growing as fast as those of semi-conductors were ahead of 1959 this year , and should increase again in 1961 .In sum , I look for another good year for the electronics industry in 1961 , with total sales increasing about 7% to $10.8 billion , despite the uncertainties in the business outlook generally .As I have indicated above , I base this feeling on a belief that current weakness in the market for consumer durable goods may continue through the early months of the year , but will give way to a sufficiently strong recovery later on to bring the full-year figures close to those of 1960 ; ;on prospects for continued increases in defense spending ; ;and on continued growth in the applications of electronics to the complex problems of manufacturing and trade in the expanding but competitive economy of the 1960's .
The appointment of Gilbert B. Devey as General Manager of VecTrol Engineering , Inc. , of Stamford , Connecticut , a leading manufacturer of thyratron and silicon controlled rectifier electrical controls , has been announced by David B. Peck , Vice President , Special Products .Mr. Devey will be responsible for the commercial expansion of VecTrol's line of electronic and electrical power control components as furnished to end equipment manufacturers , working closely with Walter J. Brown , President and Director of Engineering of the recently acquired Sprague subsidiary .Mr. Brown will at the same time undertake expansion of VecTrol's custom design program for electronic control users with a greatly increased engineering staff .Mr. Devey's new responsibilities are in addition to those of his present post as marketing manager of Sprague's Special Products Group , which manufactures a wide line of digital electronic components , packaged component assemblies , and high temperature magnet wires .Mr. Devey first came to Sprague in 1953 as a Product Specialist in the Field Engineering Department , coming from the Office of Naval Research in Washington , D. C. , where he was an electronic scientist engaged in undersea warfare studies .
During World War 2 , , he was a lieutenant commander in the United States Navy .Mr. Devey is a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , and attended the United States Naval Academy Post-Graduate School specializing in electronic engineering .He was named Product Manager of the Special Products Division of Sprague when it was founded in 1958 , and was later promoted to his present post .Mr. Devey is a member of the Institute of Radio Engineers , and is chairman of the Electronic Industries Association Committee on Printed and Modular Components .Mr. Brown , well-known , English-born inventor , prior to founding VecTrol was at various times section leader in radio research at Metropolitan Vickers Electrical Co. , Ltd. ; ;
chief engineer of the radio set division of Electric and Musical Industries , Ltd. , the largest electronic equipment manufacturer in Great Britain ; ;director of engineering at Philco of Great Britain , Ltd. , and vice president in charge of production and assistant to the president at The Brush Development Co. , Cleveland , Ohio .He has a Bachelor of Science from the University of Manchester , England .Mr. Brown presently has over 130 patents to his credit dating back to 1923 .He is a fellow of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers , and a senior member of the Institute of Radio Engineers .
He is a member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers , London , a registered professional engineer in Connecticut and Ohio , and a chartered electrical engineer in Great Britain .The promotion of Robert E. Swift to the position of Assistant Manager of the Interference Control Field Service Department was announced early in December by Frederick S. Scarborough , Manager of Interference Control Field Service .The appointment was made in a move to expand the engineering services offered to the designers of electronic systems through assistance in electro-magnetic compatability problems .Between meetings he helps the president keep track of delegated matters .Since these duties fit neatly with those of the proposed presidential aide , one person , with adequate staff assistance , could fill both jobs .
Since faculty see themselves as self-employed professionals rather than as employees , enthusiasm in a common enterprise is proportionate to the sense of ownership they have in it by virtue of sharing in the decisions that govern its course .The faculty believes that broad autonomy is necessary to preserve its freedom in teaching and scholarship .The president expects faculty members to remember , in exercising their autonomy , that they share no collective responsibility for the university's income nor are they personally accountable for top-level decisions .He may welcome their appropriate participation in the determination of high policy , but he has a right to expect , in return , that they will leave administrative matters to the administration .How well do faculty members govern themselves ? ?
There is little evidence that they are giving any systematic thought to a general theory of the optimum scope and nature of their part in government .They sometimes pay more attention to their rights than to their own internal problems of government .They , too , need to learn to delegate .Letting the administration take details off their hands would give them more time to inform themselves about education as a whole , an area that would benefit by more faculty attention .Although faculties insist on governing themselves , they grant little prestige to a member who actively participates in college or university government .
There are , nevertheless , several things that the president can do to stimulate participation and to enhance the prestige of those who are willing to exercise their privilege .He can , for example , present significant university-wide issues to the senate .He can encourage quality in faculty committee work in various ways : by seeing to it that the membership of each committee represents the thoughtful as well as the action-oriented faculty ; ;by making certain that no faculty member has too many committee assignments ; ;by assuring good liaison between the committees and the administration ; ;
by minimizing the number of committees .Despite the many avenues for the exchange of ideas between faculty and administration , complaints of a lack of communication persist .The cause is as often neglect as hesitance to disclose .A busy president , conversant with a problem and its ramifications and beset by pressures to meet deadlines , tends naturally to assume that others must be as familiar with a problem as he is .The need for interchange and understanding makes vital the full use of all methods of consultation .
To increase faculty influence and decrease tension , many presidents have established a standing advisory committee with which they can discuss problems frankly .The president has little influence in day-by-day curricular changes , but if he looks ahead two , three , or five years to anticipate issues and throw out challenging ideas , he can open the way for innovation , and he can also have a great deal to say as to what path it will take .Success will require tact , sensitivity to faculty prerogatives , patience , and persistence .The critical task for every president and his academic administrative staff is to assure that the college or university continually rebuilds and regenerates itself so that its performance will match changing social demands .Great professors do not automatically reproduce themselves .
Deans can form an important bridge between the president and the faculty .They serve not only as spokesmen for their areas , but they also contribute to top-level decision making .The president who appoints strong men who have an all-college or university point of view and a talent and respect for administration can count on useful assistance .Faculty members depend on their department chairmen to promote their interests with the administration .The administration at the same time , looks to the chairmen for strategic aid in building stronger departments .
