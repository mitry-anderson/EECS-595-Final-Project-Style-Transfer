`` Was it something went bad with the breathing '' ? ?`` The equipment was fine '' , Rob stated , standing up .
He was a huge young man of twenty-four , clothed in muscle , immensely strong , with a habitual gentleness and diffidence of manner that was submerged under his present agitation .He stared stonily at the floor .
`` I was down to 275 .I've been that far half a dozen times .
I don't get it why this time I should pull such a stupid trick '' .`` Well , I get it '' , Artie said , still on the ladder .
`` You are a big muscle-bound ape and you got this idea about setting a record .And you also got this little spark in your bird-brain that tells you to turn around before you drown yourself .
So you turn around '' .`` No , it wasn't that '' , Rob said .
A note of awe came into his voice .`` When I came up , damnit , I thought I was going down .
I came up maybe fifty feet before I knew what was happening '' .`` Pressure-happy '' , Artie said , and climbed in .
`` That's right '' , Robinson said .`` I was expecting it , sure .
But when it happens to you like that , I tell you , and you're a hundred feet from where you thought you were -- well , it makes you think .You don't head back down again .
Not me , anyway .Not right away '' .
He had his voice under control again : no one became aware that he was terrified by what had just happened to him .Waddell , the newspaperman , was a fellow in his middle forties , with a graying crewcut , heavy-framed glasses , and a large jaw padded with fat .
Now he was going to show how much he knew .`` Our boy didn't chicken out , no sir .
He ran into the rapture of the depths .Nitrogen narcosis .
It makes the diver feel drunk '' .`` Well , that's the only way to be '' , Mrs. Forsythe said , and gave her brassy laugh .
`` Maybe not , if you're 200 feet under water '' , Artie said .`` Anyway '' , Waddell went on .
`` It's nothing to fool with .It can kill you .
Personally , I don't blame him for giving up the dive , much as I regret losing the story '' .`` Nobody's giving anything up '' , Robinson said .
He stood there , towering over them all : gentle , mighty , determined , the moving force in the group ; ;and yet like a child among adults .
`` You think I got you and Artie and Herr Schaffner all the way out here just for the boat ride ? ?I'm going down again '' .
`` That's my boy '' ! !Mr. Forsythe exclaimed .
`` Rob's not going to give up as easy as all that '' .He was a florid , puffy man in his early sixties , very natty in his yachting cap , striped jacket and white flannels .
He went to Key West every fall and winter and was the only man in town who did not know that his title of `` Commodore '' was never used without irony .Old Commodore Forsythe , who had once lost a fifty-dollar bet on whether he could get both motors started and turn on the running lights without accidentally turning on something else first .
Now it did not occur to him even to wonder whether it was wise for Robinson to dive again : Rob was his boy , the kid he had rescued from the streets , the object of his pride .`` Why '' , he went on , `` when Rob asked me if he could make his dive on this trip , I didn't think twice about it .
I've helped him along ever since he was a youngster hanging around his brother's tackle shop .Hell , I gave him the first decent job he ever had , six , seven -- how many years ago was it , Rob '' ? ?
`` Seven years ago , Commodore '' , Rob said impassively .He was thinking , big deal : skipper on his drunken fishing parties for seven years and no better off than when I started .
`` Excuse me '' , he said abruptly .He went down the steps to the galley and sleeping quarters ; ;
went into the forward stateroom and locked the door behind him .`` When you gotta go , you gotta go '' , Mrs. Forsythe said .
Waddell muttered something about taking a look around and climbed up to the flying bridge .He was disturbed by what had happened on the dive and by what he remembered of a conversation he had had the night before with the German , who had come out of the head while he was fixing himself a drink in the galley .
`` Hi there , Schaffner '' , he had said .`` Can I make you one '' ? ?
`` No thank you very much '' , Schaffner had answered in his accented English .`` I do not drink so much , thank you '' .
Waddell had looked the man over , trying to size him up .He was in his early forties , rather short and very compactly built , and with a manner that was reserved and stiff despite his efforts to adapt himself to American ways .
His open face seemed to promise a sort of innocence , until one looked into his eyes , which had no warmth in them but only alert intelligence .Waddell had heard that he had been a commando in Rommel's Afrika Corps , and he said to himself : I'd hate to run into him in the desert on a dark night .
Aloud he had said , making conversation :`` Rob tells me he's using your Atlantis equipment on the dive '' .
`` Yes '' , Herr Schaffner had said .`` He's one hell of a decent boy .
I like that kid '' .`` I agree , yes '' .
`` And if the dive goes OK he has the exclusive import rights to your line for this country , is that right '' ? ?`` Well , no '' , Herr Schaffner said .
Waddell turned to face him .`` No '' ? ?
He asked .`` But that's what he told me .
Why , that's his main reason for making the dive '' .Shaffner looked at him , altogether without guile , and shrugged his shoulders , making a little spreading gesture with his two hands .
`` What do you mean '' ? ?Waddell asked , frowning .
`` Please let me explain '' , the German said earnestly , his face still devoid of deceit .`` I have in Europe a gross business of seven million dollars the year .
Now I wish to enter the American market , where the competition is very strong .I must have a powerful representative here , a firm with a national distribution and ten , twenty thousand dollars to advertise my products .
With all respect to a fine young man , Mr. Roy is not able to provide these necessaries '' .Waddell was not an eminently moral person , but he did not like what he had just heard .
`` Did you tell him all this '' ? ?He asked .
`` Perhaps not in so many words '' , the German said .`` But surely you have misunderstood Mr. Roy .
Never , never did I offer him the exclusive rights .We spoke of the need for advertising , and I agreed that the deep dive would be most useful for publicity .
He was most eager to make the dive ; ;of course , I was willing .
But there was no definite agreement about business arrangements '' .`` Well , damn '' , Waddell said .
There was the end of his front-page feature story , with byline .He started out the door .
`` One moment '' ! !Herr Schaffner said .
`` You intend to speak with Mr. Roy '' ? ?`` What else '' ? ?
Waddell asked .`` If you will pardon , I think it would be better if not .
Mr. Roy is determined to make this dive .Whatever you tell him he will dive .
I know this from my talks with him '' .`` Well , let's let him make up his own mind , OK '' ? ?
Waddell said .`` On the basis of the facts '' .
`` You will make him unhappy and anxious '' , the German said .`` At 200 , 300 , 400 feet under the water , when he must be paying very much attention , he will be thinking about what you are telling him .
It is not good , Mr. Waddell : you will do him great harm '' .There was no doubt that Herr Schaffner meant every word of what he said .
Waddell came back from the door and sat on a bunk .`` I am an honest man '' , the German said with fervor .
`` I will give Mr. Roy his due for this dive .I will make him distributor for all of Florida -- a big market .
All tourists come to Florida .This will help him to get out of his little tackle shop .
Yes ! !But there is no use causing him to worry at this time '' .
The German's words worked on the newspaperman like a reprieve from an odious duty .He took a big swig of his drink .
It would be a colossal shame to throw away a story like this .`` I think maybe you're right , Schaffner '' , he said .
`` He has the distributorship for Florida , you say '' ? ?`` Yes '' , the German said .
`` At least for South Florida '' .`` By God '' , Waddell said , `` we don't want to upset the boy at this time of all times .
I guess you're right '' .He sloshed his drink around and drained it in a few large gulps .
The story was shaping up nicely in his mind : the young pioneer , as of old , altruistically braving the unknown ; ;the rewards prompt and juicy in modern big-business America .
`` Join me in another '' ? ?He had asked .
`` Thank you '' , the German had said courteously .`` I do not drink so much '' .
Now , in that same cabin , Robinson fell to his knees beside a bunk .Fear and relief mingled in his churning emotions .
He pressed his palms together and addressed himself to the patron saint of divers in a hurried and anxious whisper .`` Blessed Saint Nicholas , I thank thee for getting me out of that mess and sending me up instead of down when I was bewildered .
And when I make the dive again '' -- He paused ; ;crossed himself ; ;
said a Hail Mary , slowly and with understanding .Folding between his hands the cross that hung from his neck , he took his appeal direct to Headquarters .
`` Holy Mary , Mother of God , Star of the Sea , stay Thou with me on this next dive .Make it come off all right .
Let me set the record this time , and let me get back OK , so the German will give me the exclusive .And make my life different and better from this time on .
Amen '' .He crossed himself again and rose .
He felt a good deal less shaky .As he reached for the door there was a knock on it and when he opened he found Artie , who came in and sat down on a bunk .
Artie had picked up a snorkle and was twirling it on his forefinger .He waited awhile before he said , `` Roy , you know your decompression table , don't you '' ? ?
`` You know I know it '' , Robinson answered warily .`` You came straight up from 275 without a stop '' , Artie said .
`` Well , I was a little bit confused .Anyway , I wasn't down long enough to matter .
You don't see me stretched out on the deck , do you '' ? ?`` You know what they say about two deep dives in one day '' , Artie went on , still twirling the snorkle and studying it intently .
`` I don't think you should go down again '' .Early that day Matsuo saw a marine .
The enemy came looming around a bend in the trail and Matsuo took a hasty shot , then fled without knowing the result , ran until breath was a pain in his chest and his legs were rubbery .As his feet slowed , he felt ashamed of the panic and resolved to make a stand .
He crossed the next meadow and climbed a tree where the jungle trail resumed .In the leafiest part of the tree , straddling a broad horizontal limb , he could see over the meadow .
For a while he was content to let events develop in their good time .He had no doubt the marine was the lead scout of a column , and while his shot had probably bred indecision , they would soon come hunting .
His superiors had emphasized that marines tortured others for the sheer pleasure .Yesterday ; ;
today ; ;tomorrow : no surrender .
His remembering the self-dictate brought no peace -- only a faint chill of doubt .He murmured to himself , with firmness : `` No surrender '' .
It was best to die fighting the marines .His superiors had also preached this , saying it was the way for eternal honor .
What if the marines never came ? ?His comrades were all dead .
He had no rice .Then it would be a choice between starvation and suicide .
Whichever the way , he would rot in this vast choking green , his wife never to receive an urn of his ashes .He sighed and leaned for a moment against the trunk .
His fingers touched the bone handle of a knife .The knife , an ammunition pouch , and a half-filled bottle of purified water hung on his belt .
Besides the belt he wore a loin cloth .As he looked up from picking at a leg ulcer , he saw a marine in the jungle across the clearing .
Gloom receded .The marine came to the edge of the green jungle mist and stayed , as though debating whether to brave the sunlight .
His fatigues made a streak of almost phosphorescent green in the mist .`` Come out , come out in the meadow '' , Matsuo said under his breath .
The man leaned against a tree and wiped a sleeve across his face .A signal ? ?
Matsuo lifted his rifle , easing the sling under his left upper arm for steadiness .Fresh on his mind were events of the past day when his whole regiment was destroyed in the hills .
They had fought from caves , and the marines resorted to burning them out .Even now , like a ringing in his ears , he heard the wooooosh of flame-throwers squirting great orange billows .
A wave of flame rippling through their cave had reached Nagamo , his friend , and with a shriek the man bolted through the entrance , then slowed to the jerky walk of a puppet , his uniform blazing .The marines let him advance .
When he sank on his knees , they had allowed him to char without administering the stroke of mercy .Matsuo had faked death and was pitched on a stack of corpses , both the burned and the unburned , the latter decomposing rapidly under the tropical sun .
The callous marines had laughed at each other's retching , while stacking bodies .Matsuo repeatedly choked down his own nausea .
At nightfall he had been able to sneak down a hillside and into the jungle , reeking of death .Apprehensively he peered to the left , to the right into the leafy , vine-crisscrossed maze .
He decided that the marines must be deploying around the meadow , with the one left to distract him .He strained his hearing .
Cautious feet stepping on leafmold ; ;faint creaking of belts and slings ; ;
whispers : he heard none of these .Only the hum of insects and the distant fluttering call of a bird .
Because he couldn't hear them , he was more convinced they were there .A spectacle occurred across the meadow : the lone marine took a seat on the ground ; ;
leaning sidewise on a tree trunk , he embraced it .Humiliation made Matsuo tremble .
While his comrades cocked the trap , that one behaved as if it was some dull maneuver .Taking aim at the man's face , Matsuo squeezed the trigger up to the point of discharge , and then he changed his mind .
He wanted the arrogant marine to know fear , and so he aimed above the head .The shot reverberated in diminishing whiplashes of sound .
Hush followed .Like a mischievous boy expecting punishment , Matsuo awaited reaction from the jungle .
How stupid to give his position away .The jungle did not retort .
The sitter remained seated hugging the tree .Before long the atmosphere reverted to its old normalcy , and insects hummed and birds occasionally called .
Matsuo puzzled and grew anxious over the complete passiveness , concluding that he was the butt of a devilish joke .Five or so minutes later the marine abruptly pulled up and stepped into sunlight , immediately throwing his hands over his eyes .
He went into a whirling dance , a sort of blind chasing of the tail .It ended when he tumbled ; ;
but jumping right up , he staggered in no particular direction .He wore no head cover of any kind and , more odd , had no visible weapon .
With a sudden decisiveness he lurched in Matsuo's direction , crossing the meadow in a zigzagging gallop .When he got closer to the tree , Matsuo noted the wild look on his face .
The pockets of his jacket bulged .Hand grenades .
The bobbing head was a poor target , so Matsuo shot him in the upper trunk .The marine spun , clapping a hand high on his chest , and dived forward .
In the hush that followed the echoes , Matsuo was tense .They could come on him now without difficulty .
Gradually he reached a conclusion .The marine was alone , for they were impatient people and by now would have vied to knock him from the tree .
Down the tree he scrambled and knelt at the edge of foliage .The marine was sprawled some thirty yards away , one arm extended .
Matsuo jumped when the hidden arm flopped out .Reflex ? ?
Rifle leveled on the man , he made a rush .Heat , in the sunlight , pressed in like an invisible crowd .
He squatted by the head , gently placing the rifle on the ground .With a snakestrike motion he grasped the hair , and , twisting , pulled the marine over on his back .
He was bearded .The bullet had penetrated in the area of the right collarbone ; ;
around the hole , blood glistened in a little patch .Maintaining his clutch on the hair , Matsuo watched the closed eyes while rummaging in the jacket pockets .
In one : a package of cigarettes and a tinplated lighter , both sticky from the man's bleeding .In the other : a wristwatch with broken crystal wrapped in a dirty handkerchief .
One by one he tossed the objects aside .He didn't smoke and could not light fires with a flintless lighter ; ;
he had no use any longer for exact time , even had the watch been running .Then there was no saying how many times the marine had blown his nose on the handkerchief .
Too bad the marine had no water .From its holder he took his own canteen .
The cap was stuck and made a thin rusty squeaking as he applied pressure .The marine's eyes opened , squeezed shut , then opened squinted in the glare .
So , alive .Matsuo put the bottle to his own lips .
The marine reached up a hand .Matsuo shook his head .
`` None for you '' .The marine blinked , soon dropping his hand .
Not only had he no canteen , but he lacked even the belt to hang one on .`` You came well equipped to die '' .
Some odor made him lean over the man .He sniffed and recognized it .
Sake .So that had been his difficulty .
Drunk on sake , he must have wandered off from his bivouac .The marine tried to roll on his right side , and moaned .
When he rolled on the left side , propping on his left elbow , Matsuo seized his hair and pulled him back over .`` Be a good turtle '' .
Awkwardly with one hand Matsuo got the cap back on the water bottle .The smell of sake had freshened yesterday's events in his thoughts .
In the caves , with other supplies , they had kept cases of sake .The marine shut his eyes .
`` Are you a thrower of flame , marine '' ? ?Matsuo took the small knife from its scabbard and laid it on the ground , out of the marine's reach and away from their shadows .
He waited in his squat , gripping the hair .Every so often he turned the knife .
Its blade was dazzling in the intense sunlight .The sun was noon high and Matsuo perspired until his body was dripping .
Wet also were the marine's fatigues and the face had an oily film .The man had thrown the left hand over his eyes .
Now and again he murmured something that ended in a giggle .He must have saturated himself in the drink , for the bullet not to shock him out of his drunken haze .
Matsuo shook his head .Strange .
At last he reached for the knife .Even the bone handle scorched , and he retrieved the marine's handkerchief to wrap it .
First he barely touched the blade on the hand which shaded the eyes .The marine yelled and flung the hand away .
With a firm grip on the man's hair Matsuo applied the blade flat on a cheek .A shrill yelp , kicked legs , and groping hands that circled Matsuo's wrist .
Matsuo wrenched free and burned the hands into retreat ; ;burned the other cheek ; ;
burned each hand when they came groping again .The marine commenced to weep and it blighted the sense of enjoyment .
Matsuo stood up .`` A small measure of payment , marine '' .
He dropped the knife in its scabbard , hung the rifle behind a shoulder .The marine , hands on cheeks , rolled by his unwounded side onto his stomach .
He ceased weeping .Matsuo walked toward his tree , once glancing back .
The marine was still .He would soon die .
As Matsuo climbed by using the vines and kicking his feet against the trunk , a mood of gloom immersed him like a jungle shadow .What now ? ?
In the jungle , birds were mute , while insects preserved only the monotony of living .Someone called .
It was the marine : head lifted , he strained and called .Then he astonished Matsuo by pushing and dragging himself until he sat .
He cupped his mouth and yelled .Matsuo hustled the rifle off his shoulder .
Once and for all he'd finish this marine who would not die .He aimed , but listened .
It sounded as if the man were calling him : `` Hey , Japanese hey there , Japanese '' .The man tilted back his head and went through the pantomime of drinking from a container .
He performed the act twice more , and the begging in his tone grew more distinct .`` Sake '' ? ?
Matsuo called .The marine nodded vigorously .
Matsuo laughed , slung the rifle .The marine was a winehead .
His superiors had said that all marines were depraved .The marine slumped forward into a bow like a priest before an idol .
Remembering his own thirst , Matsuo took out his water bottle .One swallow was all he would have ; ;
he was very thirsty , but he must observe water discipline .His years of campaigning had taught him the value of water discipline .
He began to uncap the bottle , the rusty cap squealing on its threads .Popping upright , the marine waved both hands and shouted .
Of course it was water he really craved ; ;down in the broil of the sun he was becoming dried out .
The marine shouted for it until it seemed that his voice had to crack .Matsuo shook his head .
He had no water for an enemy .And when this was gone , he hadn't even a little bitter tablet to purify other water if he were to discover some stagnant jungle pool .
He capped the bottle and replaced it .After all , he had less reason to desire it than the marine .
Before much longer the marine quieted down .His head slumped .
The upper part of his packet had stained dark .`` Marine .
There is nothing for you '' , Matsuo said .`` Your superiors will certainly beat you for your desertion , besides the dishonor of it .
I've nothing for you '' .From the convulsive quivers of the man's shoulders it was plain he had resumed the weeping .
He reminded Matsuo of a similar thing he had witnessed in China .In China it was a baby sitting on a railroad platform , smudged , blood-specked , with the village burning about him and shells exploding .
Chairs scraped back and customers hastily vacated their tables as the tall young buffalo hunter pushed open the swing doors and walked towards the bar .Only Blue Throat and his gang stayed where they were .
Blue Throat was slumped with his back against the bar , elbows supporting his massive frame .He leered at the stranger as the distance between them closed .
`` Since when did they allow beardless kids into the saloon bars of this town , boys '' ? ?He asked .
`` Seems to me I don't remember altering any law about that '' .He straightened up , alert now as the buffalo hunter came closer .
`` Stay right here where you are , kid '' , he called .`` I don't aim to have minors breathing down my neck when I'm a-drinking '' :
The stranger ignored him .He didn't stop till he was within three feet of Blue Throat and by that time the gang leader's right hand was on the butt of his revolver .
`` I'm Billy Tilghman '' , said the stranger , `` and I've come for Pat Conyers' body '' .`` And what makes you think you're going to get it , pretty boy '' ? ?
`` Because I'm asking .Most of the time I get what I ask for '' .
Blue Throat winked at his six cronies .`` The kid has no manners , boys .
Shall we teach him some '' ? ?His gun was half drawn when he asked the question , but the weapon never left its holster .
Tilghman's clenched fist swept over in a terrific right cross and clipped the big gunfighter on the side of his chin .His head snapped round and he reeled back , crashing into the table where his buddies were sprawling .
Tilghman leapt on to him , dragged him upright and hit him again , this time sending him careening against the bar .A bullet gouged into the bar top an inch from Tilghman's stomach as Blue Throat's henchmen started shooting .
Tilghman flung himself aside , dropped on one knee and pulled his own gun .The Colt roared twice and two men dropped , writhing .
A third shot doused the light .Somewhere at the far end of the room a voice yelled , `` You all right , Billy '' ? ?
`` Yes , George , but I ain't got poor old Pat's body yet .And I aim to have it '' .
He fired again , and somewhere in the gloom a man screamed .Another took off his gun belt and flung his weapons to the floor .
`` OK , Tilghman , I'm quitting '' .`` And me '' , said another Blue Throat henchman .
Somebody brought a light .Tilghman and his partner , George Rust , herded the men into a corner .
`` And now '' , said Tilghman with deadly calm , `` I'll repeat what I said .I've come for Pat Conyers' body '' .
In two minutes the body of Tilghman's former comrade , who had been killed by Blue Throat in a gambling brawl the previous night , was carried into the town's funeral parlor to be prepared for decent burial .Blue Throat , nursing an aching jaw and a collosal dose of wounded pride , rode out of town with the survivors of the fight .
`` That critter will be back tomorrow '' , predicted George Rust , `` and he'll bring fifty of his kind back with him .Blue Throat won't stand for this .
He'll shoot up the town '' .The prediction was correct .
The Reverend James Doran had scarcely completed Pat Conyers' last rites on Boot Hill in the township of Petrie , when shots were heard in the distance .`` Amen '' , said the Reverend Doran , grabbing his rifle propped up against a tombstone , `` and now my brethren , it would seem that our presence is required elsewhere '' .
Billy Tilghman and his comrades rode off to the battle .Blue Throat , who had ruled the town with his six-shooter for the last six months , certainly had no intention of relinquishing his profitable dictatorship .
It was essential that he should restore his formidable reputation as a rip-roaring , ruthless gun-slinger , and this was the time-honored Wild West method of doing it .He rode in at the head of sixty trigger-happy and liquor-crazed desperadoes and took over a livery barn at the entrance to Main Street .
The entire length of the street could be raked with rifle fire from this barn .Any posse riding down the street to demand Blue Throat's surrender would be wiped out with one deadly burst of fire .
The law-abiding citizens of Petrie had gathered inside Kaster's Store , halfway down the street .Several were firing into the barn when Billy Tilghman arrived .
He sized up the situation and shook his head .`` If Blue Throat has his way he'll keep us all cooped up in here for days '' , he said .
`` There's only one thing to move him fast , and we have it right here in this very store '' .He called the store owner and together they went into the stockroom .
Billy returned with six sticks of dynamite .`` I'm gonna drop these into Blue Throat's lap '' , he announced , `` and I'd like every gun to be firing into that barn while I get near enough to toss 'em through the window '' .
He slipped outside , hugging the walls of buildings and dodging into doorways .Blue Throat's men spotted him and a hail of bullets splintered the store fronts and board walk as he passed .
Fifty yards away from the barn he dodged inside a barber's shop and came out at the back .Here he couldn't be seen by Blue Throat and his gang .
All he had to do was light the fuses of the dynamite sticks , run to within ten yards of an open window in the barn and hurl the sticks through .Billy Tilghman did just that .
Within seconds the big barn was blasted into smoking splinters , with every outlaw either dead or injured inside .It was the abrupt end of Blue Throat's dictatorship in Petrie .
Though only slightly injured himself the big hoodlum never returned to those parts .To Tilghman the incident was just one of a long list of hair-raising , smash-'em-down adventures on the side of the law which started in 1872 when he was only eighteen years old , and did not end till fifty years later when he was shot dead after warning a drunk to be quiet .
Of all the rip-roaring two-fisted tough boys of the Old West , `` Uncle Billy Tilghman '' stands out head and shoulders .He was the lawman who survived more gunfights than any other famous gun-slinging character in the book .
He saw the most action , beat up more badmen with his bare fists , broke up the most gangs and sent more murderers to the gallows than any other U.S. marshal who lived before or after him .For fifty years his guns and ham-like fists shot holes through and battered the daylights out of the enemies of law and order in the frontier towns of the West .
The deeds of countless western bandits and outlaws have been glorified almost to the point of hero-worship , but because Billy Tilghman remained strictly on the side of the law throughout his action-packed career , his achievements and the appalling risks he took while taming the West have remained almost unsung .Citizens took the view that a lawman was expected to risk his life on the odd occasion anyway , but this fighting fury of a man risked it regularly over a period of half a century .
He came within an ace of being riddled with bullets during his long fight with the Doolin gang which terrorized Oklahoma in the 1890's .Led by Bill Doolin , these mobsters specialized in train robberies but as a sideline they looted stores and robbed banks , making liberal use of their guns .
Bill Doolin's ambition , it appeared , was to carve out his name with bullets alongside those of Jesse James and Billy the Kid , and Bill Tilghman had sworn he would stop him .Tilghman knew that some ranchers were hand-in-glove with the Doolin gang .
They bought rustled cattle from the outlaw , kept him supplied with guns and ammunition , harbored his men in their houses .Billy decided to set an example by arresting one of the ranchers , named Ed Dunn , who lived at Rock Fort .
On a bitterly cold day in January , 1895 , accompanied only by Neal Brown as his deputy , Tilghman left the township of Guthrie and headed for Rock Fort and Dunn's ranch .It was snowing hard when they got there and they saw no horses outside .
The only evidence of occupation came from the chimney , which was belching out thick smoke .The two lawmen halted their wagon about twenty yards from the door .
`` Wait here , Neal '' , said Tilghman .`` If I don't come out within half an hour ride back to town and bring out a posse '' .
Leaving his rifle in the wagon , Tilghman walked up to the door and hammered on it .There was no reply so he shoved it open with his foot and stepped inside .
Directly opposite the door was a roaring log fire , a welcome sight on that bitterly cold day .Seated near it with his back to the door was the rancher , Ed Dunn .
`` Hello , Ed '' , said Tilghman .The rancher grunted an acknowledgement but didn't move .
Tilghman closed the door behind him and walked towards the fire .Suddenly he saw something which made his big heart give a sickening lurch and caused the hairs to bristle on the back of his neck .
Along each side of the room were six tiered bunks , each one screened off with a curtain .And projecting wickedly through these curtains were the gleaming muzzles of six rifles , all trained on Billy Tilghman .
The fighting marshal had walked right into a trap and at any moment six slugs might slam into his hide .Thinking fast , Tilghman never hesitated for one instant .
He walked right up to the fire as though blissfully unaware of the guns covering him .The men behind them were Bill Doolin and five of his gang -- every man a killer .
`` Cold day '' , said Tilghman , placing his hands behind him and casually presenting his backside to the fire .`` Just dropped in to ask where Jed Hawkins lives .
Can't seem to locate landmarks in this snow '' .The rancher was trembling .
He wouldn't look Tilghman in the face .`` Follow the river for five miles '' , he said hoarsely .
`` Jed's homestead is on the south bank '' .Resisting the overwhelming temptation to flng himself out of that bristling death-trap , Tilghman deliberately engaged the nervous rancher in trivial conversation for a good ten minutes .
All that time rifle barrels were pointing unwaveringly at his head and body .One false move on his part and he would be a dead man .
`` Well '' , he announced , `` Guess I'll be going now , Ed , and thanks for the warmup '' .He strolled back to the door , whistling softly , hands still clasped behind him .
He left the house and almost certain death without even increasing his pace and wondered by what remarkable stroke of Providence he had been allowed to come out alive .But he knew well enough that those guns would still be trained on his back as he walked towards the wagon .
If he showed signs of collecting his rifle and going back with his deputy to the ranch he would be shot down instantly .Leisurely he climbed on to the wagon next to Neal Brown .
`` Don't say or do anything '' , he said softly .`` Just get out of here without it looking as though we're in a hurry .
That place is crawling with Bill Doolin and his gang '' .Even as he spoke those words Billy Tilghman's life hung on a thread .
Back in the house a hoodlum named Red Buck , sore because Billy had been allowed to leave unscathed , jumped from a bunk and swore he was going after him to kill him right then .`` You'll stay right here '' , commanded Bill Doolin , covering Red with his rifle .
`` Billy Tilghman is too good a man to shoot in the back .We'll let him go '' .
But the fighting marshal's fifty-year run of immunity from violent death came to a full and final stop one night in a street at Cromwell , Oklahoma , where he had been sent to clean up the gambling and vice rackets .Wiley Lynn , a self-styled prohibition officer , had hit town the previous day and had been drinking ever since .
That night he reeled out of Ma Murphy's dance hall and proceeded to disturb the peace by shooting off his revolver .For several months now , Jack Carter , a big overgrown boy of fifteen with a fuzzy , pimpled face and greenish catlike eyes with a lot of red in them , had been haunted by a dream , a vision , of a Woman .
This Woman had no distinct shape or size and no particular face , but she radiated warmth , a sweet warmth ; ;she would talk to him in a soothing voice about things his mother would have said were not nice and put her hands on him and kiss him passionately .
When she would do these things , he would turn blind for an instant and become sick at his stomach .Then he would run to the toilet behind the house .
Sometimes he did this three or four times a day , for this Woman was almost always with him .He would feel ashamed each time and wonder whether his mother and father knew -- thinking they might see it in his eyes or smell it on him .
But they never said anything , so he figured it was all right .And so when Miss Langford came to teach at the one-room Chestnut school , where Jack was a pupil in the eighth grade , the Woman of Jack's mind assumed the teacher's face and figure .
He could not keep his eyes off her when at school ; ;when he went home at night , he took her with him in his mind , and she did the things the anonymous Woman used to do , and he did the thing afterwards each time as he used to do .
When he awoke in the mornings , she was in his mind and he could hardly wait to get to school to be near her in the flesh .Miss Langford ( her first name was Evelyn ) was an attractive girl .
Tall , blonde , blue-eyes , fair , buxom without being heavy , she cut a fine figure of budding womanhood as she swished among the pupils in her fresh , starched summer dress .Something was beginning to stir and come alive in her , too ( it may have been there for a good while , since she was twenty now ; ;
but if it had been , it had been smothered until now by fear ) : you could tell it by the way she watched the older , bigger boys , like Jack .She would look at Jack , with that hidden something in her eyes , and Jack would see the Woman and become breathless and a little sick .
School began in August , the hottest part of the year , and for the first few days Miss Langford was very lenient with the children , letting them play a lot and the new ones sort of get acquainted with one another .The first two or three days they went home early .
All , that is , except Jack .He hung around the schoolhouse , watching through a window from outside while Miss Langford straightened desks and put the room in order .
Once ( this was on the third day of school ) she kneeled down to pick up some books where they'd dropped on the floor and Jack looked up her dress -- at the bare expanse of incredibly white leg .He thought for a moment his heart had stopped beating .
About that time Miss Langford straightened up and looked out the window directly at him , he thought , although probably she didn't even see him .He jumped back , ducked and ran , crouching , down the hill away from the school .
He didn't look back and he ran until he was out of sight of the schoolhouse and out of breath ; ;then he slowed to a walk .
The vision became even stronger now .`` I'll get her yet '' , he muttered to himself .
`` I've got to get her '' .That night he dreamed a dream violent with passion , in which he and the Woman , now the teacher , did everything except engage in the act ( and this probably only because he had never engaged in the act in reality ) , and when he awoke the next morning his heart was afire .
He ate litle that morning , and his mother became concerned , inasmuch as he usually ate heartily .`` What's the matter , honey '' ? ?
She said , with the solicitude of a middle-aged woman for her only child .`` Aren't you hungry '' ? ?
`` No , I'm not hungry '' , he said , pushing back the bacon and eggs .Outside it was already hot at 7:30 A.M. , and it was getting hot in the kitchen .
He felt a little sick at his stomach .`` Are you sick '' ? ?
`` No '' , he said .`` I'll be all right .
I guess it's this hot weather '' .`` Don't you play hard today then .
And if you get sick , ask the teacher to let you come home early .Daddy left the car for me , and I'm going to town this afternoon '' .
`` OK. , I won't play hard '' , he promised .Just then Charles Lever yelled , `` Hey , Jack '' , from the quarry road which ran behind the Carter house , and Jack grabbed the lunch from the table and darted out the kitchen door , yelling `` Good-bye , Mom '' over his shoulder .
`` Whaddya say , boy '' ? ?Charles said , grinning , showing his huge yellow teeth .
Charles , also fifteen , was tall and skinny , scraggly , with straight black hair like an Indian's and sharp brown eyes .He considered himself handsome and seemed to think all the girls were after him .
`` You know what I done last night '' ? ?Charles said as they picked their way over the rocky road which led up the hill away from the Dixie Highway , through a corn field and a patch of woods to the school .
Jack knew of course that the tale to be unfolded would involve a girl and probably be dirty , because girls were Charles' only apparent interest .But Jack always derived vicarious sensual thrills from Charles' revelations ( even when he suspected his friend of exaggeration or invention ) , so he usually invited them , as he did now .
`` No .What '' ? ?
`` I got Margaret Rider in one of them old box cars down there by the quarry '' .A nude imaginary picture of Miss Langford flashed across Jack's mind .
His heart beat faster .`` Hell you say '' ? ?
He said , lapsing into the profanity he often used when away from his parents and especially when he was with Charles .`` How'd you do it '' ? ?
`` Hell , I jist got on top of -- ''`` No , I mean how'd you get her to do it '' ? ?
`` Hell , I jist ask her '' .`` Jist like that '' ? ?
`` Hell , yes .She's been hangin' around me a lot here lately , and I figgered I might as well's try it .
Besides I heard her old uncle that stays there has been doin' it '' .`` I never heard that '' .
`` It's all over Branchville .If you'd get out of your back yard once in a while you might even get her your ownself '' .
`` I might try it one of these days '' , Jack said wonderingly , thinking of Miss Langford .When they reached the school , a gang of boys and girls were already there playing `` crack the whip '' in front of the schoolhouse .
Miss Langford , in a fresh white dress and low-heeled white sandals , without socks , was out there with them , trying to get them inside .`` Time for books '' , she yelled , jingling a little five-and-dime store bell in her right hand .
`` Let's go inside '' .`` Oh , come on Miss Langford , play with us just onct '' , one of the little girls begged , smiling wistfully .
`` No , not now '' , said the teacher .`` Maybe at dinner time .
Come inside now '' .The children grudgingly stopped playing then and straggled into the schoolhouse .
Jack watched Miss Langford all morning .He could think of nothing else save his mental image of her nude figure and what Charles had said that morning about Margaret Rider .
Occasionally he would look across the aisle at Margaret , fourteen and demure in a fresh green organdy dress , sitting in the sixth-grade row , and he could hardly believe she would do what Charles had said she did .At noontime , remembering what the teacher had said about maybe playing with the kids , Jack stayed close to the schoolhouse while all the other big boys , except Charles , went off out the road to play ball .
`` Why ain't you playin' ball '' ? ?He asked Charles suspiciously as they sat in the well-house shade , watching the girls congregate in front of the schoolhouse .
`` Miss Langford , come out and play with us like you promised '' , several of the little girls called .`` I'd druther stay here and watch the girls '' , Charles grinned .
`` Maybe some of 'em will fall down and we'll see up their dress '' .`` Maybe '' , Jack said idly , watching for Miss Langford .
Presently she came out of the schoolhouse .When she appeared , two or three of the little girls jumped up and down , yelling , `` Goody , goody '' .
`` Let's play with 'em '' , Jack said , rising from where he sat on the ground and dusting off his overall pants .`` O.K. '' Charles rose also , and the two of them moved over to join the girls .
They played crack the whip a few minutes without mishap .Then when Miss Langford was on the end of the line of girls , Jack , in the middle of the line , gave an extra hard pull and the young teacher sprawled backwards , sitting down hard , her dress flying over her head .
While she was struggling to get her skirt down and get on her feet again , Jack ran over , offered her his hand and said , `` Gosh , I'm sorry , Miss Langford .I didn't mean to pull so hard '' .
`` That's all right '' , she said , tossing her head back to get the hair out of her eyes .`` It was my fault '' .
With one hand she held her skirt down while she took Jack's extended hand with the other .When her hand touched his , fire went through Jack and he felt weak , but he managed somehow to get her on her feet .
He thought she gave him that look with the hidden something in it as he let her hand go .`` Thank you '' , she said , dusting herself off .
`` Will you play with us again , Miss Langford '' ? ?One of the little girls said .
`` No more today .Maybe some other day '' .
`` Oh , shucks '' , the girl said .`` I don't believe I'll play any more neither '' .
`` Me neither '' , others said , and soon the game broke up , the children going off in pairs , in larger groups and alone .Jack walked off alone out the road in the searing midday sun , past Robert Allen's three-room , tarpapered house , toward the field where the other boys were playing ball , thinking of what he would do in order to make Miss Langford have him stay in after school -- because this was the day he had decided when he thought he saw the look in her eyes .
When he came back to the schoolhouse , his mind was made up .He simply would not work his arithmetic problems when the teacher held his class .
That should do it , he thought , because Miss Langford had said she was going to be strict about school work .He had considered throwing erasers or flipping paperwads at someone or pulling the hair of the girl sitting in front of him , but he couldn't take a chance on either of these possibilities : the teacher probably would make him stand face-to-wall in a corner instead of stay in after school .
The only drawback now to the plan he'd decided on was that someone else might fail to do his work , too , and the teacher would have that person stay late along with Jack .`` But I've got to take a chance on it '' , he told himself desperately .
To his surprise his plan worked perfectly .`` All right , if you can't do your arithmetic during school hours you can do it after school is out '' , Miss Langford said firmly , not smiling .
`` You will stay here thirty minutes after the others go home this afternoon and work your problems '' .And so when the others stampeded out that afternoon Jack remained docilely in his seat near a window , looking out in what he hoped was a pitiable manner , while the other kids laughed and yelled in at him and made faces as they dispersed , going home .
He scarcely saw them .His heart was pounding like a mighty dynamo and he was trying to think , his mind seeming to scream at him like a hurt or frightened child , `` How will I do it ? ?
On the fringe of the amused throng of white onlookers stood a young woman of remarkable beauty and poise .She munched little ginger cakes called mulatto's belly and kept her green , somewhat hypnotic eyes fixed on a light-colored male who was prancing wildly with a 5-foot king snake wrapped around his bronze neck .
The youth with the snake had a natural pride and joy of life which appealed to the woman .Lithe and muscular , he had well-molded features , and his light color told of the European ancestors who had been intimate with the slave women of his family .
The haughty white girl turned to a distinguished , hawk-faced man standing at her side and murmured : `` Look at your watch , Col. Garvier .It is almost time for and calinda to begin '' .
Col. Henri Garvier was one of New Orleans' most important and enlightened slave owners .He chuckled and gave the signal for the dance to start .
The slaves ran gaily to the center of Congo Square and gathered around a sweaty youth they called Johnny No-Name .Johnny vigorously pounded two bleached steer bones against the gourd which served as his drum .
He showed his gleaming tusks of teeth and bellowed incoherently , his brass earrings jangling discordantly as he shook and trembled in ecstasy .The drummer flogged the gourd with frantic intensity as the dancers began the calinda , a sensual gyration which had long been a favorite of voodoo practitioners and their disciples in the Louisiana slave compounds .
The dance was of Haitian origin .The white girl with the penetrating green eyes sipped the lemonade handed to her by a handsome man of about 30 , who had coppery skin and beetling eyebrows .
He was possessive in his manner and , though a slave , obviously was educated after a fashion and imitated the manners of his owners .He proudly wore the blue livery of her house , for the girl was Madame Delphine Lalaurie , wife of the prominent surgeon , Dr. Louis Lalaurie , who bore one of the South's oldest and most cherished names .
Delphine was a pace-setter in high society .She was a top horsewoman and one of the city's most gracious hostesses .
Although New Orleans was not to learn of it for a spell , she also was a sadist , a nymphomaniac and unobtrusively mad -- the perpetrator of some of the worst crimes against humanity ever committed on American soil .Madame Lalaurie gestured with her riding crop toward the 20-year-old youth who was stomping and writhing with the king snake still draped over his bare shoulders .
The slender , handsome fellow was called Dandy Brandon by the other slaves .He was gifted with animal magnetism and a potent allure for women of any race .
But Dandy had had little experience with girls on his master's plantation in Bayou St. John .Shy , actually , he avoided feminine overtures and seemed truly ignorant of the girls' desires when they sought to make liaisons with him in the open fields , in carriages and in boathouses .
This young slave was therefore quite unprepared when Delphine Lalaurie signaled that she wanted him to draw near .The woman eyed the youth with the avidity a coin collector might display toward a rare doubloon which is not yet in his collection .
`` What is your name , boy ? ?Come a bit closer .
I won't bite , you know '' .He gaped at Madame Lalaurie and sniffed the Paris perfume which emanated from her .
Then he smiled shyly .`` My name is Dandy Brandon , missy .
I belong to Master Alexander Prieur '' .She said with intense feeling : `` Come near , let me feel your arms .
You look quite strong and healthy to me , Dandy '' .Mrs. Lalaurie impatiently propelled the slave toward her waiting carriage .
Lifting her skirts , she climbed in , never relinquishing her grip on his arm .The woman seemed utterly unafraid of the snake which coiled on the floor in a torpor .
Once inside the luxuriosly-upholstered landau , she drew the curtains and proceeded to give the startled youth the kind of physical examination usually reserved for army inductees .Satisfied at last , and after a few amorous gambits on her part which convinced Delphine that Dandy was capable of learning new arts , she opened the window and called to her liveried driver .
This was the big man with the proprietory air and the beetling , shaggy eyebrows .`` Aristide ! !
I want you to find Monsieur Prieur at once and give him this money for the boy's purchase .There's $600 in gold in this chamois sack .
If the old fool argues about the price , tell him I shall order my husband not to treat him as a patient any longer .Prieur has gout and depends on Louis' pills and bleedings .
Besides , he owns 300 slaves .One less shouldn't matter to him '' .
Aristide Devol , the sardonic manservant who had been brought in chains years before from his native Sierra Leone , smiled thinly and touched his well-brushed beaver hat .His bold eyes raked the woman , and a perceptive spectator might sense that there was more to their relationship than that of slave to owner .
`` Another youth , Madame '' ? ?The coachman said softly .
`` This one is a tender chicken , oui ? ?Such delicate beauty , such fine flesh .
It will rip and shred easily for Madame '' .`` Be quiet , Devol ! !
You are forgetting your place '' .The tall coachman walked off briskly in search of Alexander Prieur .
Delphine Lalaurie took the reins in her gloved hands and drove Dandy Brandon -- cowering in the back seat of the carriage -- to her mansion at 677 Perdido Street .Dr. Louis Lalaurie stood on the veranda at the head of the driveway and watched his carriage as it approached the pillared mansion .
Dandy , curiosity overcoming his apprehensions , peered out at the doctor from the window of the vehicle .He saw a pint-sized man with a graying spade beard and an unusually large head .
Dr. Lalaurie wore a maroon smoking jacket , and his myopic eyes were blurry and glistened behind thick octagonal lenses .He was about 50 years old .
`` Another young man , my dear ? ?Really , you are most indiscreet to drive him here yourself '' , he said , frowning with displeasure .
Delphine presented her cheek for a kiss , and the physician pecked it like a timid rooster .`` Dandy is to be our house guest , Louis .
I want the room in the attic prepared for him He is a most unusual lad , quite precocious in many ways .He deserves a better life than just rotting away on the Prieur plantation '' .
`` Quite so , my dear .His room will be ready shortly '' .
The physician led the horses to the stable after a cursory glance at the cringing slave .Had Dandy been older or wiser , instinct might have warned him that he would be well advised to flee from the Lalauries' tender care if he valued his life .
But he liked the smell of Delphine's perfume .Besides , her endearments and caresses in the carriage had been new and stirring experiences to the simple youth .
Also , he was weary of plantation drudgery and monotony .So Dandy Brandon trustingly entered the house with Delphine Lalaurie and trudged up the rear steps to the attic room which was to be his new home .
Airless and dingy though it was , the attic represented luxury to a slave who had led a wretched life with six brothers and sisters and assorted relatives in a shanty at Bayou St. John .He bounced exuberantly on the sagging bed and was even more delighted when Madame Lalaurie -- after closing the door -- showed the slave that the bed was designed for something other than slumber .
It was just as well that the ignorant Dandy enjoyed himself to the hilt that first evening , for the room was to become his prison cell .When he finally left the sinister mansion on Perdido Street , he was carried out in a coroner's basket .
Just six weeks after Dandy Brandon's arrival at the mansion , the little surgeon and his svelte young wife gave their annual open house and ball , to which only New Orleans' oldest and wealthiest families were invited .A stringed orchestra played softly behind the potted palms , and Delphine circulated graciously among her guests , chatting airily of the forthcoming races , the latest fashions from Paris , and Louisiana politics .
Suddenly there was a commotion upstairs , a despairing boyish shriek , and the strains of the waltz faltered and died as the musicians and guests gaped at an apparition descending the marble staircase .It was Dandy Brandon , clad only in a bloody loincloth , emaciated and quaking as if the devil were breathing hard on him .
The lad's once superb body was a mass of scars and welts .His pinched face showed the ravages of malnutrition .
Feebly he pointed an accusing finger at Madame Lalaurie and shouted : `` Evil woman ! !You did this you like to hurt to beat people I want to go home '' .
These were the last words he ever uttered .Convulsively , he spat up some blood and collapsed into the arms of Senator Gaston Berche , crimsoning the frilly shirt and waistcoat the politician wore .
Dr. Louis Lalaurie examined the inert form of the slave on the parquet dance floor and pronounced him dead .The ball broke up in confusion .
Guests stared with horror at Madame Lalaurie and made speedy departures .Delphine stood like stone , her eyes alive with hate as she looked down at the sheeted corpse .
But at the coroner's inquest Delphine told a forthright story .`` I saw the boy Dandy at the Congo Square festivities and felt sorry for him .
It was our hope to educate him and to give him his freedom when the right time came , for he was a bright and friendly youth who seemed worthy of our interest .After I paid Monsieur Prieur for Dandy , I brought him home , but he was ill at ease and ran away the same night .
How he returned in such a ghastly condition , or why , I cannot say .Dr. Lalaurie and I didn't even know he was in the house until the night of our ball when he came down the stairs '' .
She daubed at her swimming eyes with a lacy handkerchief and said with obvious emotion : `` That poor boy ! !He must have fallen in with evil companions , for he was a simple youth and quite trusting and inexperienced .
Ruffians must have robbed and beaten him before bringing him back to our house to die .Such a pitiful end '' ! !
Though the slave's dying words about the woman troubled the coroner's panel , Dandy's accusation was adjudged an aberration by the jury and disregarded .The Lalauries were at the top rung of the social ladder , and even a jury didn't feel privileged to doubt the veracity of so illustrious a lady .
Moreover , runaway slaves frequently got into serious trouble in New Orleans' dives .So the verdict was `` death at the hands of a person or persons unknown '' , and the elite of the city , accepting Delphine's testimony , welcomed her and the doctor back into the fold .
Once again life went its serene way -- soirees , fox hunts , balls and dinners .The excitement over Brandon's bizarre death abated and Madame Lalaurie's stock soared when she resumed her self-imposed chores of visiting the poor and bringing cakes and comfort to destitute patients in the county hospital .
Then , on July 2 , there occurred another incident which set tongues to wagging at a furious clip .Mrs. Victor Dominique , socially prominent and a neighbor of the Lalauries , chanced to glance out of her parlor window at dusk one evening and beheld an amazing sight .
The manservant Devol and his mistress , Delphine Lalaurie , were pursuing a young girl -- an octoroon of cameo-like beauty -- across the front lawn of the Lalaurie mansion .The girl was not more than 16 .
She was nude to the waist and her tumbled abundance of black hair did not conceal the knife slashes on her back .The bleeding girl was tiring fast ; ;
the coachman and Delphine were gaining on her as she raced down Perdido Street .The fugitive cried out in an oddly sibilant voice : `` Help me , somebody ! !
They have pulled out all my teeth and now she will carve out my tongue with her hacksaw ! !`` Bastards '' , he would say , `` all I did was put a beat to that Vivaldi stuff , and the first chair clobbered me '' ! !
Since then , and since the pure grain had gotten him divorced from every decent -- and even indecent -- group from Greenwich Village to the Embarcadero , he had become a sucker-rolling freight-jumper .`` There ain't nothin' faster , or lonelier , or more direct than a cannonball freight when you wanna go someplace '' , Feathertop would say .
`` The accommodations may not be the poshest , but man ! !There ain't nobody askin' for your ticket stub , neither '' .
He had been conning the freights for a long , long time now .Ever since the hooch , and the trouble with the Quartet , and Midge and the child .
Ever since all that .It had been a very long time that had no form and no end .
He was -- as he told himself in the vernacular of a trade no longer his own -- riding the dark train out .Out and out and never to return again .
Till one day the last freight had been jumped , the last pint had been killed , the last beat had been rapped .That was the day it ended .
The freight car was cold , early in the morning .He was pressed far back into the corner of the car on his hay sacks , the rattling and tinning of the wheels on the rails almost covering the sound of his ocarina .
He held his elbows away from his body , and the little sweet potato trilled neatly and sweetly as he tickled its tune-belly .The train slowed at a road crossing , and the big door slid open ; ;
at first gratingly , caught by grains of corn -- then with a clash into its slot .The boy lifted the girl by the waist and set her on the lip of the floor .
She pulled her legs up under her , to rise , her full peasant skirt drawing up her thighs , and Feathertop's music pfffted away .`` Now that is a very nice , a very nice '' , he murmured to himself , back in his corner .
A little thing , but the right twist for the action that counted .Hot , that was the word , hot ! !
Hair like a morning-frightened sparrow's wings , with the sun shining down over them .A poet , yet ! !
His thoughts for the swanlike neck , the full , high breasts , the slim waist , and the long legs were less than poetic , however .Zingggg-O ! !
Then the boy straight-armed himself up , twisting at the last moment so he landed sitting .He was less to see , but Feathertop took him in , too , just to keep the records straight .
Curly hair , high cheekbones , wide gnomelike mouth , a pair of drummer's blocky hands , and a body that said well , maybe I can wrestle you for ten minutes -- but then I'm finished .`` We made it , Cappy '' , the chick said .
`` Yeah , seems so , don't it '' , the boy laughed , hugging her close .`` Ah-ah '' ! !
Feathertop interrupted , standing up , brushing the pig offal from his dirty pants .`` None of that .
We run a respectable house here '' .They whirled and saw him , standing there dim in the slatted light from the boarded freight wall .
He was big , and filthy , and his toes stuck out of the flapping tops of his shoes .He held the black plastic kazoo lightly .
`` Come sit '' , said Feathertop , motioning them toward him .`` That crap is softer over here '' .
The girl smiled , and started forward .The boy yanked her back hard , tugging her off her feet , and gathered her into the crook of his arm .
`` Now stay with me , Kitty '' , he snapped irritably .`` I vowed to take care of you -- and that's what I'm gonna do .
We don't know this guy '' .`` Oooo , square bit '' , Feathertop screwed his face up .
This guy was strictly from Outsville .But nowhere ! !
`` What is with this vow jazz '' ? ?Feathertop inquired , lounging against the freight's vibrating wall .
`` We -- we eloped '' , Cappy said .His head came up and he said it defiantly .
`` Well , congratulations '' .Feathertop made an elaborate motion with his hand .
These two were going to be easy pickins .They couldn't have much dough , but then none of the freight-bums Feathertop rolled had much .
And besides , the chick had a little something the others didn't have .That was gonna be fun collecting ! !
But not just yet .Feathertop was a connoisseur .
He liked to savor his meat before he tasted it .`` Come sit '' , he repeated , motioning to the piled hay bags , over the pig leavings .
`` I'm just a poor ex-jazz man , name of -- uh -- Boyd Smith '' .He grinned at them wolfishly .
`` That ain't your name , Mister '' , the boy accused .`` And you know -- you're right '' ! !
Feathertop aimed a finger at him .`` Oh , come on , Cappy '' , the girl chided .
`` He's okay .He's a nice guy '' .
She started to move toward the hay bags , dragging the reluctant Cappy behind her .Feathertop watched the smooth scissoring of her slim , trim legs as she walked to the bags , and tucked them beneath her , smoothing the skirt out in a wide circle .
He cleared his throat ; ;it had been a long , hot while since he'd seen anything as nice as this within grabbin' distance .
He had it all doped , of course .Slug the kid , grab his dough -- at least enough to get to Philadelphia -- and then have a rockin' ball with the doll .
Hmm -- diddle ! !`` Where'd you come from , Mr. -- uh -- Mr. Smith '' ? ?
Kitty inquired politely .`` Where from '' ? ?
He mused .`` Out .
I been riding train for a ways now '' .They lapsed into silence , and the freight wallowed up a hill , scooted down the other side , shaking and clanking to itself .
After a while , Kitty murmured something to Cappy , and he held her close , answering , `` We'll just have to wait till we pull into Philly , honey '' .`` What's the matter , she wanna go the bathroom '' ? ?
Ernie found it immensely funny .The boy scowled at him , and the girl looked shocked .
`` No ! !Certainly not , I mean , no that isn't what I said '' ! !
She snapped at him .`` I only said I was hungry .
We haven't had anything to eat all day '' .Joviality suffused Feathertop Ernie Cargill's voice as he reached behind him , pulling out a battered carpet bag , with leather handles .
`` Whyn't ya say so , fellow travelers ! !Why , we got dinner right here .
